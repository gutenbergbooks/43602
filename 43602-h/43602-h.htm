<h2>ARCHITECTURE.</h2>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</a>

<span class="subhead">ANCIENT OR HEATHEN ARCHITECTURE.<br />

3000 B.C. TO A.D. 328.</span></h2>

<p class="in0"><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="dropleftmid">RCHITECTURE</span> seems to me to be the most wonderful
of all the arts. We may not love it as much as
others, when we are young perhaps we cannot do so,
because it is so great and so grand; but at any time of life
one can see that in Architecture some of the most marvellous
achievements of men are displayed. The principal
reason for saying this is that Architecture is not an imitative
art, like Painting and Sculpture. The first picture that
was ever painted was a portrait or an imitation of something
that the painter had seen. So in Sculpture, the first
statue or bas-relief was an attempt to reproduce some being
or object that the sculptor had seen, or to make a work
which combined portions of several things that he had
observed; but in Architecture this was not true. No
temples or tombs or palaces existed until they had first
taken form in the mind and imagination of the builders,
and were created out of space and nothingness, so to speak.
Thus Painting and Sculpture are imitative arts, but Architecture
is a constructive art; and while one may love pictures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
or statues more than the work of the architect, it seems
to me that one must wonder most at the last.</p>

<p>We do not know how long the earth has existed, and in
studying the most ancient times of which we have any
accurate knowledge, we come upon facts which prove that
men must have lived and died long before the dates of
which we can speak exactly. The earliest nations of whose
Architecture we can give an account are called heathen
nations, and their art is called Ancient or Heathen Art, and
this comes down to the time when the Roman Emperor
Constantine was converted to Christianity, and changed the
Roman Capitol from Rome to Constantinople in the year
of our Lord 328.</p>

<p>The buildings and the ruins which still remain from these
ancient times are in Egypt, Assyria, Persia, Judea, Asia
Minor, Greece, Etruria, and Rome. Many of these have
been excavated or uncovered, as, during the ages that have
passed since their erection, they had been buried away
from sight by the accumulation of earth about them.
These excavations are always going on in various countries,
and men are ever striving to learn more about the wonders
of ancient days; and we may hope that in the future as
marvellous things may be revealed to us as have been
shown in the past.</p>

<h3>EGYPT.</h3>

<p>As we consider the Architecture of Egypt, the Great
Pyramid first attracts attention on account of its antiquity
and its importance. This was built by Cheops, who is
also called Suphis, about 3000 years before Christ. At
that distant day the Egyptians seem to have been a nation
of pyramid-builders, for even now, after all the years that
have rolled between them and us, we know of more than
sixty of these mysterious monuments which have been
opened and explored.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
Of all these the three pyramids at Ghizeh (<a href="#illus001">Fig.&nbsp;1</a>) are
best known, and that of Cheops is the most remarkable
among them. Those of you who have studied the history
of the wars of Napoleon I. will remember that it was near
this spot that he fought the so-called Battle of the Pyramids,
and that in addressing his soldiers he reminded
them that here the ages looked down upon them, thus referring
to the many years during which this great pyramid had
stood on the border of the desert, as if watching the flight
of Time and calmly waiting to see what would happen on
the final day of all earthly things.</p>

<p>There have been much speculation and many opinions
as to the use for which these pyramids were made, but the
most general belief is that they were intended for the tombs
of the powerful kings who reigned in Egypt and caused
them to be built.</p>

<p>The pyramid of Cheops was four hundred and eighty feet
and nine inches high, and its base was seven hundred and
sixty-four feet square. It is so difficult to understand the
size of anything from mere figures, that I shall try to make
it plainer by saying that it covers more than thirteen acres
of land, which is more than twice as much as is covered by
any building in the world. Its height is as great as that of
any cathedral spire in Europe, and more than twice that of
the monument on Bunker Hill, which is but two hundred
and twenty feet, and yet looks very high.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 264px;"><img id="illus002" src="images/illus002.jpg" width="264" height="329" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.&mdash;The Ascent of a Pyramid.</span></div></div>

<p>When it was built it was covered with a casing of stone,
the different pieces being fitted together and polished to a
surface like glass; but this covering has been torn away
and the stones used for other purposes, which has left the
pyramid in a series of two hundred and three rough and
jagged steps, some of them being two feet and a half in
height, growing less toward the top, but not diminishing
with any regularity. The top is now a platform thirty-two
feet and eight inches square. Each traveller who ascends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
this pyramid has from one to four Fellahs or Arabs, who
pull him forward or upward by his arms, or push him and
lift him from behind, and finally drag him to the top (<a href="#illus002">Fig.&nbsp;2</a>).
When he thinks of all the weary months and days of
the twenty years during which it is said that those who
built it worked, cutting out the stone in the quarries, moving
it to the
spot where it
was required,
and then raising
it to the great
heights and fitting
it all in
place, he regards
his fatigue
in its ascent
as a little
thing, though
at the time it is
no joke to him.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 213px;"><img id="illus003" src="images/illus003.jpg" width="213" height="359" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.&mdash;View of Gallery in the Great Pyramid.</span></div></div>

<p>Many of the
pyramids were
encased in
stone taken
from the Mokattam
Mountains,
which
were somewhat
more than half a mile distant; but the pyramid of Cheops was covered
with the red Syenite granite, which must have been quarried
in the "red mountain," nearly five hundred miles
away, near to Syene, or the modern Assouan. The interior
of the pyramid is divided into chambers and passages (<a href="#illus003">Fig.&nbsp;3</a>), which are lined with beautiful slabs of granite and constructed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
in such a way as to prove that at the remote time
in which the pyramids were built Egyptian architects and
workmen were already skilled in planning and executing
great works. Of the seventy pyramids known to have existed
in those early days, sixty-nine had the entrance on the
north side, leaving but
a single exception to
this rule; all of them
were situated on the
western side of the
River Nile, just on the
edge of the desert, beyond
the strip of cultivable
ground which
borders the river.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 460px;"><img id="illus004" src="images/illus004.jpg" width="460" height="299" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.&mdash;Poulterer's Shop.</span></div></div>

<p>Near the pyramids
there are numerous
tombs, which are built
somewhat like low
houses, having several
apartments with but
one entrance from the
outside. The walls of
these apartments are
adorned with pictures
similar to this one of a
poulterer's shop (<a href="#illus004">Fig.&nbsp;4</a>); they represent the
manners and customs of
the ancient Egyptians
with great exactness.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 220px;"><img id="illus005" src="images/illus005.jpg" width="220" height="152" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 5.&mdash;Rock-cut Tomb, Beni-Hassan.</span></div></div>

<p>The tombs at Beni-Hassan are among the most ancient
ruins of Egypt, and are very interesting (<a href="#illus005">Fig.&nbsp;5</a>). They
were made between 2466 and 2266 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> They are on the
eastern bank of the Nile, and are hewn out of the solid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
rock; they are ornamented with sculptures and pictures
which are full of interest; it has been said that these tombs
were built by the Pharaoh, or king, of Joseph's time, and
one of the paintings is often spoken of as being a representation
of the brethren of Joseph; but of this there is no
proof. The colors of
the pictures are fresh
and bright, and they
show that many of the
customs and amusements
of that long,
long ago were similar to
our own, and in some
cases quite the same.
The manufactures of
glass and linen, cabinet
work, gold ornaments,
and other artistic objects are pictured there; the games of
ball, draughts, and <i>morra</i> are shown, while the animals,
birds, and fishes of Egypt are all accurately depicted.</p>

<p>An interesting thing to notice about these tombs is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
way in which the epistyle&mdash;the part resting upon the
columns&mdash;imitates squarely-hewn joists, as if the roof were
of wood supported by a row of timbers. When we come
to the architecture of Greece we shall see that its most
important style, the Doric, arose from the imitation in
stone of the details of a wooden roof, and from a likeness
between these tombs and the Doric order, this style has
been named the Proto-Doric.</p>

<p>The tombs near Thebes which are called the "Tombs of
the Kings," and many other Egyptian tombs, are very interesting,
and within a short time some which had not before
been observed have been opened, and proved to be rich in
decorations, and also to contain valuable ornaments and
works of art, as well as papyri, or records of historical value.</p>

<p>The most magnificent of all the Egyptian tombs is that
of King Seti I., who began to reign in 1366 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> He was
fond of splendid buildings, and all the architects of his time
were very busy in carrying out his plans. His tomb was
not discovered until 1817, and was then found by an Italian
traveller, whose name, Belzoni, has been given to the tomb.
The staircase by which it is entered is twenty-four feet long,
and opens into a spacious passage, the walls of which are
beautifully ornamented with sculptures and paintings.
This is succeeded by other staircases, fine halls, and corridors,
all of which extend four hundred and five feet into
the mountain in which the tomb is excavated, making also
a gradual descent of ninety feet from its entrance. It is a
wonderful monument to the skill and taste of the architects
who lived and labored more than three thousand years ago.</p>

<p>The two principal cities of ancient Egypt were Memphis
and Thebes. The first has been almost literally taken to
pieces and carried away, for as other more modern cities
have been built up near it, the materials which were first
used in the old temples and palaces have been carried here
and there, and again utilized in erecting new edifices.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
Thebes, on the contrary, has stood alone during all the
centuries that have passed since its decline, and there is
now no better spot in which to study the ancient Egyptian
architecture, because its temples are still so complete that a
good idea can be formed from them of what they must have
been when they were perfect. The ruins at Thebes are on
both banks of the Nile, and no description can do justice to
their grandeur, or give a full estimate of their wonders;
but I shall try to tell something of the palace-temple of
Karnak, which has been called "the noblest effort of architectural
magnificence ever produced by the hand of man."</p>

<p>The word palace-temple has a strange sound to us
because we do not now associate the ideas which the two
words represent. Many palaces of more modern countries
and times have their chapels, but the union of a grand
temple and a grand palace is extremely rare, to say the
least. Perhaps the Vatican and St. Peter's at Rome represent
the idea and spirit of the Egyptian palace-temples as
nearly as any buildings that are now in existence.</p>

<p>The Egyptian religion controlled all the affairs of the
nation. The Pharaoh, or king, was the chief of the religion,
as well as of the State. When a king came to the
throne he became a priest also, by being made a member of
a priestly order. He was instructed in sacred learning; he
regulated the service of the temple; on great occasions he
offered the sacrifices himself, and, in fact, he was considered
not only as a descendant of gods, but as a veritable god.
In some sculptures and paintings the gods are represented
as attending upon the kings, and after the death of a king
the same sort of veneration was paid to him as that given
to the gods. This explains the building of the palace and
temple together, and shows the reason why the gods and the
kings, and the affairs of religion and of government, could
not be separated. As we study the arts of different countries
we are constantly reminded that the religion of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
people is the central point from which the arts spring forth.
From its teachings they take their tone, and adapt their
forms and uses to its requirements. I refer to this fact
from time to time because it is important to remember that
it underlies much of the art of the world.</p>

<p>It may be said that all the art of Egypt was devoted to
the service of its religion. Of course this is true of that
used in the decoration of the temples; it is also true of all
that did honor to the kings, because they were regarded as
sacred persons, and all their wars and wonderful acts which
are represented in sculpture and painting, and by statues
and obelisks, are considered as deeds that were performed
for the sake of the gods and by their aid.</p>

<p>It was also the religious belief in the immortality of the
soul that led the Egyptians to build their tombs with such
care, and to provide such splendid places in which to lay
the body, which was the house of the spirit.</p>

<p>In the study of Architecture it will also be noted that a
country which has no national religion&mdash;or one in which the
government and the religion have no connection with each
other&mdash;has no absolutely national architecture. It will have
certain features which depend upon the climate, the building
materials at command, and upon the general customs of
the people; but here and there will be seen specimens of
all existing orders of architecture, and buildings in some
degree representing the art of all countries and periods;
such architecture is known by the term composite, because
it is composed of portions of several different orders, and
has no absolutely distinct character.</p>

<p>This palace-temple of Karnak is made up of a collection
of courts and halls, and it is very difficult to comprehend
the size of all these parts which go to make up the enormous
whole. The entire space devoted to it is almost
twice as large as the whole area of St. Peter's at Rome, and
four times as great as any of the other cathedrals of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
Europe; a dozen of the largest American churches could
be placed within its limits and there still be room for a few
chapels. All this enormous space is not covered by roofs,
for there were many courts and passages which were always
open to the sky, and one portion was added after another,
and by one sovereign and another, until the completion of
the whole was made long after the Pharaoh who commenced
it had been laid in one of the tombs of the kings.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 411px;"><img id="illus006" src="images/illus006.jpg" width="411" height="209" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 6.&mdash;The Hall of Columns at Karnak.</span></div></div>

<p>The most remarkable apartment of all is called the great
Hypostyle Hall, which high-sounding name means simply a
hall with pillars (<a href="#illus006">Fig.&nbsp;6</a>). This hall and its two pylons, or
entrances, cover more space than the great cathedral of
Cologne, which is one of the largest and most famous
churches of all Europe.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 140px;"><img id="illus007" src="images/illus007.jpg" width="140" height="354" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 7.&mdash;Pillar from Thebes.</span></p>

<p>Showing the three parts.</p></div></div>

<p>This splendid hall had originally one hundred and thirty-four
magnificent columns, of which more than one hundred
still remain; they are of colossal size, some of them being
sixty feet high without the base or capital, which would
increase them to ninety feet, and their diameter is twelve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
feet. This large number of columns was necessary to
uphold the roof, as the Egyptians knew nothing of the
arch, and had no way of supporting a covering over a space
wider than it was possible to cover by beams. The hall
was lighted by making the columns down the middle half
as high again as the others, so that
the roof was lifted, and the light
came in at the sides, which were
left open.</p>

<p>As I must speak often of columns,
it is well to say here that
the column or pillar usually consists
of three parts&mdash;the base, the
shaft, and the capital (<a href="#illus007">Fig.&nbsp;7</a>). The
base is the lowest part on which the
shaft rests. Sometimes, as in the
Grecian Doric order, the base is
left out. The capital is the head
of the column, and is usually the
most ornamental part, giving the
most noticeable characteristics of
the different kinds of pillars. The
shaft is the body of the pillar, between
the base and capital, or all
below the capital when the base is
omitted.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 82px;"><img id="illus010" src="images/illus010.jpg" width="82" height="317" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 10.&mdash;Pillar from Sedinga</span>.</div></div>

<p>The Egyptian pillars seem to
have grown out of the square stone
piers which at first were used for
support. The square corners were
first cut off, making an eight-sided pier; then some architect
carried the cutting farther, and by slicing off each corner
once more gave the pillar sixteen sides. The advantage
of the octagonal piers over the square ones was that the
cutting off of sharp corners made it easier for people to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
move about between them, while the play of light on the
sides was more varied and pleasant to the eye. The sixteen-sided
pillar did not much increase
the first of these advantages, while the
face of its sides became so narrow that
the variety of light and shade was less
distinct and attractive. It is probable
that the channelling of the sides of the
shaft was first done to overcome this
difficulty, by making the shadows deeper
and the lights more striking; and
we then have a
shaft very like that
of the Grecian
Doric shown in the picture in <a href="#illus040">Fig.&nbsp;40</a>,
or the Assyrian pillars in Figs. <a href="#illus029">29</a> and
<a href="#illus030">30</a>. In the Egyptian pillars
it was usual to leave
one side unchannelled and
ornament it with hieroglyphics.
In time the
forms of the Egyptian pillars
became very varied,
and the richest ornaments were used upon
them. The columns in the hall at Karnak are
very much decorated with painting and sculptures,
as <a href="#illus006">Fig.&nbsp;6</a> shows. The capitals represent
the full-blown flowers and the buds of the
sacred lotus, or water-lily. In other cases the
pillars were made to represent bundles of the
papyrus plant, and the capitals were often beautifully
carved with palm leaves or ornamented
with a female head. (See Figs. <a href="#illus008">8</a>, <a href="#illus009">9</a>, and <a href="#illus010">10</a>).</p>

<p>The whole impression of grandeur made by the Temple
of Karnak was increased by the fact that the Temple of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
Luxor, which is not far away, is also very impressive and
beautiful, and was formerly connected with Karnak by an
avenue bordered on each side with a row of sphinxes cut
out of stone. These were a kind of statue which belonged
to Egyptian art, and originated in an Egyptian idea,
although a resemblance to it exists in the art of other
ancient countries (<a href="#illus011">Fig.&nbsp;11</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 309px;"><img id="illus011" src="images/illus011.jpg" width="309" height="313" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 11.&mdash;The Great Sphinx.</span></div></div>

<p>Before the Temple of Luxor stood Colossi, or enormous
statues, of Rameses the Great, who built the temple, and
not far distant were two fine obelisks, one of which is now
in Paris.</p>

<p>There was much irregularity in the lines and plan of
Egyptian palaces and temples. It often happens that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
side walls of an apartment or court-yard are not at right
angles; the pillars were placed so irregularly and the decorations
so little governed by any rule in their arrangement,
that it seems as if the Egyptians were intentionally regardless
of symmetry and regularity.</p>

<p>The whole effect of the ancient Thebes can scarcely be
imagined; its grandeur was much increased by the fact that
its splendid buildings were on both banks of the Nile,
which river flowed slowly and majestically by, as if it borrowed
a sort of dignity from the splendid piles which it
reflected, and which those who sailed upon its bosom
regarded with awe and admiration. There are many other
places on the Nile where one sees wonderful ruins of ancient
edifices, but we have not space to describe or even to name
them, and Thebes is the most remarkable of all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span></p>
<p>The obelisks of ancient Egypt have a present interest
which is almost personal to everybody, since so many of
them have been taken away from the banks of the Nile and
so placed that they now overlook the Bosphorus, the Tiber,
the Seine, the Thames, and our own Hudson River; in
truth, there are twelve obelisks in Rome, which is a larger
number than are now standing in all Egypt.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 447px;"><img id="illus012" src="images/illus012.jpg" width="447" height="346" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 12.&mdash;Cleopatra's Needles.</span></div></div>

<p>The above cut (<a href="#illus012">Fig.&nbsp;12</a>) shows the two obelisks known
as Cleopatra's Needles, as they were seen for a long time
at Alexandria. They have both crossed the seas; one was
presented to the British nation by Mehemet Ali, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
other, which now stands in Central Park, was a gift to
America from the late Khedive of Egypt, Ismail Pasha.</p>

<p>The obelisks were usually erected by the kings to express
their worship of the gods, and stood before the
temple bearing dedications of the house to its particular
deity; they were covered with the quaint, curious devices
which served as letters to the Egyptians, which we call
hieroglyphics, and each sovereign thus recorded his praises,
and declared his respect for the special gods whom he
wished to honor. They were very striking objects, and
must have made a fine effect when the temples and statues
and avenues of sphinxes, and all the ancient grandeur of
the Egyptians was at its height; and these grave stone
watchmen looked down upon triumphal processions and
gorgeous ceremonials, and kings and queens with their
trains of courtiers passed near them on their way to and
from the temple-palaces.</p>

<p>It is always interesting to study the houses and homes
of a people&mdash;domestic architecture, as it is called; but one
cannot do that in Egypt. It may almost be said that but
one ancient home exists, and as that probably belonged to
some royal person, we cannot learn from it how the people
lived. There were many very rich Egyptians outside of the
royal families, and they dwelt in splendor and luxury; on
the other hand, there were multitudes of slaves and very
poor people, who had barely enough to eat to keep them
alive and enable them to do the work which was set them
by their task-masters.</p>

<p>The house of which we speak is at Medinet Habou, on
the opposite side of the Nile from Karnak (<a href="#illus013">Fig.&nbsp;13</a>). It
has three floors, with three rooms on each floor, and is very
irregular in form. But if we have no ancient houses to
study in Egypt, we can learn much about them from the
paintings which still exist, and we may believe that the
cities which surrounded the old temples fully displayed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
wealth and taste of the inhabitants. These pictures show
the houses in the midst of gardens laid out with arbors,
pavilions, artificial lakes, and many beautiful objects, such
as we see in the fine gardens of our own day.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 268px;"><img id="illus013" src="images/illus013.jpg" width="268" height="146" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 13.&mdash;Pavilion at Medinet Habou.</span></div></div>

<p>After about 1200 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> there was a long period of decline
in the architecture of Egypt; occasionally some sovereign
tried to do as the older kings had done, but no real revival
of the arts occurred until the rule of the Ptolemies was
established; this was after 332 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, when Alexander the
Great conquered the Persians, who had ruled in Egypt
about one hundred and ninety-five years.</p>

<p>Under the Ptolemies Egypt was as prosperous as she
had been under the Pharaohs, but the arts of this later time
never reached such purity and greatness as was shown in
the best days of Thebes; the buildings were rich and
splendid instead of noble and grand, or, as we might say,
"more for show" than was the older style.</p>

<p>It is singular that, though the Egypt of the Ptolemies
was under Greek and Roman influence, it still remained
essentially Egyptian. It seems as if the country had a sort
of converting effect upon the strangers who planned and
built the temples of Denderah, and Edfou, and beautiful
Philæ, and made them try to work and build as if they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
were the sons of the pure old Egyptians instead of foreign
conquerors. So true is this that before <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 1799, when
scholars began to read hieroglyphics, the learned men of
Europe who studied art believed that these later temples
were older than those of Thebes.</p>

<p>Outside of Thebes there is no building now to be seen
in Egypt which gives so charming an impression of what
Egypt might be as does the lovely temple on the island of
Philæ (<a href="#illus014">Fig.&nbsp;14</a>). Others are more sublime and imposing,
but none are so varied and beautiful.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 318px;"><img id="illus014" src="images/illus014.jpg" width="318" height="263" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 14.&mdash;Temple on the Island of Philæ.</span></div></div>

<p>There is no more attractive spot in Egypt than this
island, and when we know that the priests who served in
the Temple of Isis here were never allowed to leave the
island, we do not feel as if that was a misfortune to them.
It was a pity, however, that none but priests were allowed
to go there, and in passing I wish to note the fact that this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
was the most ancient monastery of which we know; for
that it was in simple fact, and the monks lived lives of strict
devotion and suffered severe penance.</p>

<p>The buildings at Philæ, as well as most of those of the
Ptolemaic age, had the same irregularity of form of which
we have spoken before; their design, as a whole, was fine,
but the details were inferior, and it often happens that the
sculpture and painting which in the earlier times improved
and beautified everything, lost their effect and really injured
the appearance of the whole structure.</p>

<p>At first thought one would expect to be able to learn
much more about the manners and customs of the later
than of the earlier days of Egypt, and to find out just how
they arranged their dwellings. But this is not so, for history
tells us of nothing save the superstitious religious
worship of the conquerors of Egypt. There are no pictures
of the houses, or of the occupations and amusements of the
people; no warlike stories are told; we have no tombs with
their instructive inscriptions; not even the agricultural and
mechanical arts are represented in the ruins of this time.
The fine arts, the early religion, the spirit of independence
and conquest had all died out; in truth, the wonderful
civilization of the days of the pyramid-builders and their
descendants was gone, and when Constantine came into
power Egypt had lost her place among the nations of the
earth, and her grandeur was as a tale that is told.</p>

<p>The weakness of Egyptian architecture lay in its monotony
or sameness. Not only did it not develop historically,
remaining very much the same as long as it lasted, but the
same forms are repeated until, even with all their grandeur,
they become wearisome. The plan of the temples varies
little; the tendency toward the shape of the pyramid
appears everywhere; while the powerful influence of the
ritual of the Egyptian religion gives a strong likeness
among all the places of worship. The Greeks performed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
the most important parts of their service in the open air
before their temples, and almost all their care was lavished
on exteriors; the Egyptians, on the other hand, elaborated
the interior with great abundance of ornaments, yet without
that power of adaptation which gave so great an air of
variety and grace to Grecian art.</p>

<p>A second and even more serious fault in Egyptian architecture
is a want of proportion. In natural organized
objects there is always a fixed proportion between the parts,
so that if a naturalist is given a single bone of an animal he
can reproduce with considerable exactness the entire beast.
In art it is necessary to follow this principle of adapting one
part to another, and without this both grace and refinement
are wanting. The Egyptian temples are often too massive,
so that they impress by their size simply, and not by any
beauty of plan or arrangement.</p>

<p>Yet for grandeur and impressiveness no nation has ever
excelled the Egyptians as builders. One may prefer the
style and the ornamentation of the Greeks, or the forms
and arrangement of the Gothic order; but, taken as a
whole, the combination of architecture, sculpture, painting,
and hieroglyphics which goes to make up an Egyptian
temple, with the addition of the obelisks, the avenues of
sphinxes and the Colossi, which all seemed to belong
together&mdash;these, one and all, result in a whole that has
never been surpassed in effect during the thirty centuries
that have rolled over the earth since Cheops built his magnificent
tomb on the great desert of Egypt.</p>

<h3>ASSYRIA.</h3>

<p>Our knowledge of Egyptian history is more exact than
that of some other ancient nations, because scholars have
been able to read Egyptian hieroglyphics for a much longer
time than they have read the cuneiform or arrow-headed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
inscriptions which are found in Assyria, Babylon, and
Persia. But we know a great deal about the ruins of
Assyria, and especially of the cities of Nineveh and Khorsabad,
where there are wonderful architectural remains.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 389px;"><img id="illus015" src="images/illus015.jpg" width="389" height="141" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 15.&mdash;Gateways in Walls of Khorsabad.</span></div></div>

<p>The walls which surrounded Nineveh are an important
part of its ruins. It is said that in the days of the earliest
sovereign these walls were one hundred feet high, and so
broad that three chariots could drive abreast on their top.
This story does not seem unreasonable, for all the years
that have passed, and all the dust and deposit of these ages
that are collected about the foot of the walls, still leave
some places where they are forty-six feet high and from
one to two hundred feet wide. The lower portion was of
limestone, and the upper of sun-dried bricks; the blocks of
stone were neatly hewn out and smoothly polished. The
walls surrounded the city, which was so large that one
hundred and seventy-five thousand people could live there,
and we know that its inhabitants were very numerous.
The gates which opened through the walls were surmounted
by lofty towers, and it is supposed that shorter towers were
built upon the walls between the gateways (<a href="#illus015">Fig.&nbsp;15</a>).</p>

<p>The above plans show the arrangement of gateways
which have been excavated. It seems that there were four
separate gates, and between them large chambers which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
may have been used by soldiers or guards. The two outer
gates were ornamented by sculptured figures of colossal
bulls with human heads and other strange designs; but the
inner gates had a plain finish of alabaster slabs. It is
thought that arches covered these gateways like some representations
of gates which are seen on Assyrian bas-reliefs.
Within the gates there is a pavement of large slabs,
in which the marks worn by chariot wheels are still plainly
seen.</p>

<p>We learn that the Assyrians made their religion a prominent
part of their lives. The inscriptions of the kings
begin and end with praises and prayers to their gods, and
on all occasions religious worship is spoken of as a principal
duty. We know that the monarchs devoted much care to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
the temples, and built new ones continually; but it also
appears from the excavations that have been made that
they devoted the best of their art and the greatest sum of
their riches to the palaces of their kings. The temple was
far less splendid than the palace to which it was attached as
a sort of appendage. This was undoubtedly due to the fact
that the Assyrian kings
received more than the
monarchs of any other
ancient people divine honors
while still living; so
that the palace was regarded
as the actual dwelling
of a god. The inner
ornamentation of the temples
was confined to religious
subjects represented
on sculptured slabs upon
the walls, but no large
proportion of the wall was
decorated, and the rest
was merely plastered and
painted in set figures.
The gateways and entrances
were guarded by
sacred figures of colossal
bulls, or lions (<a href="#illus016">Fig.&nbsp;16</a>),
and covered with inscriptions;
there was a similarity between the palace entrances
and those of the temples.</p>

<p>The palaces were always built on artificial platforms,
which were made of solid brick or stone, or else the outside
walls of the platforms were built of these substances and
the middle part filled in with dirt and rubbish. Sometimes
the platforms, which were from twenty to thirty feet high,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
were in terraces and flights of steps led up and down from
one to another. It also happened that more than one
palace was erected on the same platform; thus the size and
form of the platforms was much varied, and when palaces
were enlarged the platforms were changed also, and their
shape was often very irregular. The tops of the platforms
were paved with stone slabs or bricks, the last being sometimes
as much as two feet square; the pavements were
frequently ornamented with artistic designs (<a href="#illus017">Fig.&nbsp;17</a>), and
inscriptions are also found upon them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 383px;"><img id="illus018" src="images/illus018.jpg" width="383" height="187" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 18.&mdash;Remains of Propylæum, or Outer Gateway, Khorsabad.</span></div></div>

<p>At the lower part of the platform there was a terrace on
which several small buildings were usually placed, and near
by was an important gateway, or, more properly, a propylæum,
through which every one must pass who entered the
palace from the city. The next cut (<a href="#illus018">Fig.&nbsp;18</a>) shows one
of these grand entrances decorated with the human-headed
bulls and the figure of what is believed to be the Assyrian
Hercules, who is most frequently represented in the act of
strangling a lion. Much rich ornament was lavished on
these portals, and the entrance space was probably protected
by an arch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
Below these portals, quite down on a level with the city,
there were outer gateways, through which one entered a
court in front of the ascent to the lower terrace.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 266px;"><img id="illus019" src="images/illus019.jpg" width="266" height="279" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 19.&mdash;Plan of Palace, Khorsabad.</span></div></div>

<p>The principal apartments of the palaces were the courts,
the grand halls, and the small, private chambers. The fine
palaces had several courts each; they varied from one hundred
and twenty by ninety feet, to two hundred and fifty
by one hundred and fifty feet in size, and were paved in the
same way as the platforms outside (<a href="#illus019">Fig.&nbsp;19</a>).</p>

<p>The grand halls were the finest portions of these splendid
edifices; here was the richest ornament, and the walls
were lined with sculptured slabs, while colossal bulls, winged
genii, and other figures were placed at the entrances. Upon
the slabs the principal events in the lives of the monarchs
were represented, as well as their portraits, and religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
ceremonies, battles, and many incidents of interest to the
nation (<a href="#illus020">Fig.&nbsp;20</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;"><img id="illus020" src="images/illus020.jpg" width="550" height="321" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 20.&mdash;Relief from Khorsabad. A Temple.</span></div></div>

<p>The slabs rested on the paved floors of the halls and
reached a height of ten or twelve feet; above them the
walls were of burnt brick, sometimes in brilliant colors; the
whole height of the walls was from fifteen to twenty feet.
The smaller chambers surrounded these grand halls, and the
number of rooms was very large; in one palace which has
been but partially explored there are sixty-eight apartments,
and it is not probable that any Assyrian palace had
less than forty or fifty rooms on its ground floor. Of all
the palaces which have been examined that of Khorsabad
is best known and can be most exactly described. It is
believed that Sargon, a son of Sennacherib, built it, and it
is very splendid.</p>

<p>After entering at the great portal one passes through
various courts and corridors; these are all adorned with
sculptures such as have been described above; at length<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
one reaches the great inner court of the palace, which was a
square of about one hundred and fifty feet in size. This
court had buildings on two sides, and the other sides extended
to the edge of the terrace of the platform on which
the palace was built, and commanded broad views of the
open country. On one side the buildings contained the less
important apartments of the officers of the court; the
grand state apartments were on the other side. There were
ten of these at Khorsabad; five were large halls, four were
smaller chambers, and one a long and narrow room. Three
of the large halls were connected with one another, and their
decorations were by far the most splendid of any in the
palace. In one of them the sculptures represented the king
superintending the reception and chastisement of prisoners,
and is called the "Hall of Punishment." The middle hall
has no distinguishing feature, but the third opened into the
"Temple Court," on one side of which the small temple
was situated. The lower sculptures of the middle and third
halls represented the military history of Sargon, who is
seen in all sorts of soldier-like positions and occupations;
some of the upper sculptures represent religious ceremonies.</p>

<p>On one side of the Temple Court there were several
chambers called Priests' Rooms, but the temple itself and
the portions of the palace connected with it are not as well
preserved as the other parts, and have nothing about them
to interest us in their study.</p>

<p>The palaces of Nineveh are much less perfect than the
palace-temples of Thebes, and cannot be described with as
much exactness. There is no wall of them still standing
more than sixteen feet above the ground, and we do not
even know whether they had upper stories or not, or how
they were lighted&mdash;in a word, nothing is positively known
about them above the ground floors, and it is very strange
that the sculptures nowhere represent a royal residence.
But what we do know of the Assyrians proves that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
equalled and perhaps excelled all other Oriental nations as
architects and designers, as well as in other departments of
art and industry.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 421px;"><img id="illus021" src="images/illus021.jpg" width="421" height="307" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 21.&mdash;Restoration of an Assyrian Palace.</span></div></div>

<p>This representation of an Assyrian palace (<a href="#illus021">Fig.&nbsp;21</a>) is a
restoration, as it is called, being made up by a careful study
of the remains and such facts as can be learned from bas-reliefs,
and cannot be wholly unlike the dwellings of the king-gods.
It is pleasing in general appearance, and for lightness
and elegance is even to be preferred to Egyptian architecture,
though it is far inferior in dignity and impressiveness.</p>

<p>The Assyrians knew the use of both column and arch,
but never developed either to any extent. They also
employed the obelisk, and it is noticeable that instead of
terminating it with a pyramid, as was the case in Egypt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
they capped it with the diminishing terraces, which is the
fundamental form which underlies all the architecture of the
country, as the smooth pyramid is the most prominent
element in the architecture of Egypt.</p>

<h3>BABYLON.</h3>

<p>It is probable that Babylon was the largest and finest of
all the ancient cities. The walls which surrounded it,
together with its hanging gardens, were reckoned among
the "seven wonders of the world" by the ancients. Its
walls were pierced by a hundred gates and surmounted by
two hundred and fifty towers; these towers added much to
the grand appearance of the city; they were not very high
above the walls, and were probably used as guard-rooms by
soldiers.</p>

<p>The River Euphrates ran through the city. Brick walls
were built upon its banks, and every street which led to the
river had a gateway in these walls which opened to a
sloping landing which extended down to the water's edge;
boats were kept at these landings for those who wished to
cross the stream. There was also a foot-bridge across the
river that could be used only by day, and one writer,
Diodorus, declares that a tunnel also existed which joined
the two sides of the river, and was fifteen feet wide and
twelve feet high in the inside.</p>

<p>The accounts of the "Hanging Gardens" make it seem
that they resembled an artificial terraced mountain built
upon arches of masonry and covered with earth, in which
grew trees, shrubs, and flowers. It is said by some writers
that this mountain was at least seventy-five feet high, and
occupied a square of four acres; others say that in its
highest part it reached three hundred feet; but all agree
that it was a wonderful work and very beautiful.</p>

<p>In the interior of the structure machinery was concealed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
which raised water from the Euphrates and filled a reservoir
at the summit, from which it was taken to moisten the
earth and nourish the plants. Flights of steps led up to the
top, and on the way there were entrances to fine apartments
where one could rest. These rooms, built in the walls
which supported the structure, were cool and pleasant, and
afforded fine views of the city and its surroundings. The
whole effect of the gardens when seen from a distance was
that of a wooded pyramid. It seems a pity that it should
have been called a "Hanging Garden," since, when one
knows how it was built, this name is strangely unsuitable,
and carries a certain disappointment with it.</p>

<p>The accounts of the origin of this garden are interesting.
One of them says that it was made by Semiramis, a queen
who was famous for her prowess as a warrior, for having
conquered some cities and built others, for having dammed
up the River Euphrates, and performed many marvellous
and heroic deeds. It is not probable that any woman ever
did all the wonders which are attributed to Semiramis, but
we love to read these tales of the old, old time, and it is
important for us to know them since they are often referred
to in books and in conversation.</p>

<p>Another account relates that the gardens were made by
Nebuchadnezzar to please his Median queen, Amytis, because
the country round about Babylon seemed so barren
and desolate to her, and she longed for the lovely scenery
of her native land.</p>

<p>What we have said will show that the Babylonians were
advanced in the science of such works as come more properly
under the head of engineering; their palaces were
also fine, and their dwelling-houses lofty; they had three
or four stories, and were covered by vaulted roofs. But
the Babylonians, like the Egyptians, lavished their best art
upon their temples. The temple was built in the most
prominent position and magnificently adorned. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
usually within a walled inclosure, and the most important
temple at Babylon, called that of Belus, is said to have had
an area of thirty acres devoted to it. The chief distinguishing
feature of a Babylonish temple was a tower built in
stages (<a href="#illus022">Fig.&nbsp;22</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 452px;"><img id="illus022" src="images/illus022.jpg" width="452" height="277" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 22.&mdash;Elevation of the Temple of the Seven Spheres at Borsippa.</span></div></div>

<p>The number of the stages varied, eight being the largest.
At the summit of the tower there was a chapel or an altar,
and the ascent was by steps or an inclined plane which
wound around the sides of the tower. The Babylonians
were famous astronomers, and it is believed that these
towers were used as observatories as well as for places of
worship. At the base of the tower there was a chapel for
the use of those who could not ascend the height, and near
by, in the open air, different altars were placed, for the
worship of the Babylonians included the offering of sacrifices.</p>

<p>Very ancient writers describe the riches of the shrines at
Babylon as being of a value beyond our belief. They tell
of colossal images of the gods of solid gold; of enormous
lions in the same precious metal; of serpents of silver,
each of thirty talents' weight (a talent equalled about two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
thousand dollars of our money), and of golden tables, bowls,
and drinking-cups, besides magnificent offerings of many
kinds which faithful worshippers had devoted to the gods.
These great treasures fell into the hands of the Persians
when they conquered Babylon.</p>

<p>The Birs-i-Nimrud has been more fully examined than
any other Babylonish ruin, and a description of it can be
given with a good degree of correctness. As it now stands,
every brick in it bears the name of Nebuchadnezzar; it is
believed that he repaired or rebuilt it, but there is no
reason to think that he changed its plan. Be this as it
may, it is a very interesting ruin (<a href="#illus023">Fig.&nbsp;23</a>). It was a temple
raised on a platform and built in seven stages; these
stages represented the seven spheres in which the seven
planets moved (according to the ancient astronomy), and a
particular color was assigned to each planet, and the stages
colored according to this idea. That of the sun was golden;
the moon, silver; Saturn, black; Jupiter, orange; Mars,
red; Venus, pale yellow, and Mercury, deep blue.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 419px;"><img id="illus023" src="images/illus023.jpg" width="419" height="328" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 23.&mdash;Birs-i-Nimrud, near Babylon.</span></div></div>

<p>It is curious to know how the various colors were
obtained. The lower stage, representing Saturn, was covered
with bitumen; that of Jupiter was faced with bricks
burned to an orange color; that of Mars was made of bricks
from a bright red clay and half burned, so that they had a
blood-red tint; the stage dedicated to the sun was probably
covered with thin plates of gold; that of Venus had pale
yellow bricks; that of Mercury was subjected to intense
heat after it was erected, and this produced vitrification and
gave it a blue color; and the stage of the moon was coated
in shining white metals.</p>

<p>Thus the tower rose up, all glowing in colors and tints
as cunningly arranged as if produced by Nature herself.
The silvery, shining band was probably the highest, and
had the effect of mingling with the bright sky above. We
can scarcely understand how glorious the effect must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
been, and when we try to imagine it, and then think of the
present wretched condition of these ruins, it gives great
force to the prophecies concerning Babylon which foretold
that her broad walls should be utterly broken down, her
gates burned with fire, and the golden city swept with the
besom of destruction.</p>

<p>We know so little of the arrangement of the palaces of
Babylon that we cannot speak of them in detail. They
differed from those of Assyria in two important points:
they are of burnt bricks instead of those dried in the sun
which the Assyrians used, and at Babylon in the decoration
of the walls colored pictures upon the brick-work took the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
place of the alabaster bas-reliefs which were found in the
palaces of Nineveh.</p>

<p>These paintings represented hunting scenes, battles, and
other important events, and were alternated with portions
of the wall upon which were inscriptions painted in white
on a blue ground, or spaces with a regular pattern of
rosettes or some fixed design in geometrical figures. A
sufficient number of these decorations have been found in
the ruins of Babylon to prove beyond a doubt that this was
the customary finish of the walls. We also know that the
houses of Babylon were three or four stories in height, but
were rudely constructed and indicate an inferior style of
domestic architecture.</p>

<h3>PERSIA.</h3>

<p>The Persians were the pupils of the Assyrians and Babylonians
in Art, Learning, and Science, and they learned
their lessons so well that they built magnificent palaces and
tombs. Temples seem to have been unimportant to them,
and we know nothing of any Persian temple remains that
would attract the attention of travellers or scholars.</p>

<p>The four most important Persian palaces of which we
have any good degree of knowledge are that of Ecbatana,
the ruins of which are very imperfect; a second at Susa, of
which the arrangement is known; a third at Persepolis,
which is not well enough preserved for any exact description
to be given; and a fourth, the so-called Great Palace,
near Persepolis, in which the latest Persian sovereigns lived.
This magnificent palace was burned by Alexander the Great
before he or his soldiers had seen its splendor. The story
is that he made a feast at which Thais, a beautiful and
wicked woman, appeared, and by her arts gained such
power over Alexander that he consented to her proposal to
fire the palace, and the king, wearing a crown of flowers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
upon his head, seized a torch and himself executed the
dreadful deed, while all the company followed him with
acclamations, singing, and wild shouts. At last they surrounded
and danced about the dreadful conflagration.</p>

<p>The poet Dryden wrote an ode upon "Alexander's
Feast" in 1697 which has a world-wide reputation. I quote
a few lines from it:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Twas at the royal feast for Persia won<br /></span>
<span class="i2">By Philip's warlike son:<br /></span>

</div></div></div>

<p>Much study and time has been given to the examination
of the ruins of Persepolis, and the whole arrangement of the
city has been discovered and is made plain to the student
of these matters by means of the many charts, plans, and
photographs of it which now exist. I shall try to tell you
something of the Great Palace of Persepolis, and the other
palaces near it and on the platform with it, for the Persians,
like the Assyrians and Babylonians, built their palaces upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
platforms. This one of which we speak was distinct from
the city, but quite near it, and is in almost perfect condition.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 211px;"><img id="illus024" src="images/illus024.jpg" width="211" height="176" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 24.&mdash;Masonry of Great Platform, Persepolis.</span></div></div>

<p>It is composed of large masses of hewn stone held
together by clamps of iron or lead. Many of the blocks in
this platform wall are so large as to make their removal
from the quarries and their elevation to the required height
a difficult mechanical task, which could only have been performed
by skilled laborers with good means for carrying on
their work. The wall
was not laid in regular
blocks, but was like this
plate (<a href="#illus024">Fig.&nbsp;24</a>).</p>

<p>The platform was
not of the same height
in all its parts, and seems
to have been in several
terraces, three of which
can still be seen. The
buildings were on the
upper terrace, which is
about forty-five feet
above the plain and
very large; it is seven hundred and seventy feet long and
four hundred feet wide. The staircases are an important
feature of these ruins, and when all the palaces were in perfection
these broad steps, with their landings and splendid
decorations, must have made a noble and magnificent effect.
The ascent of the staircases was so gradual and easy that
men went up and down on horseback, and travellers now
ascend and descend in this way.</p>

<p>There is little doubt that the staircases of Persepolis
were the finest that were ever built in any part of the
world, and on some of them ten horsemen could ride
abreast. The broadest, or platform staircase, is entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
without ornament; another which leads from the platform
up to the central or upper terrace is so elaborately decorated
that it appears to be covered with sculptures. There
are colossal representations of lions, bulls, Persian guardsmen,
rows of trees, and continuous processions of smaller
figures. In some parts the sculptures represent various
nations bringing tributes
to the Persian
monarch; in other
parts all the different
officers of the court
and those of the army
are seen, and the
latter appear to be
guarding the stairs.
(See <a href="#illus025">Fig.&nbsp;25</a>.)</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 230px;"><img id="illus025" src="images/illus025.jpg" width="230" height="271" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 25.&mdash;Parapet Wall of Staircase, Persepolis (Restored).</span></div></div>

<p>In a conspicuous
position on this ornamental
staircase
there are three slabs;
on two there is no
design of any sort;
on the third an inscription
says that
this was the work of
"Xerxes, the Great
King, the King of Kings, the son of King Darius, the
Achæmenian." This inscription is in the Persian tongue,
and it is probable that it was the intention to repeat it on
the slabs which are left plain in some other languages, so
that it could easily be read by those of different nations;
it was customary with the ancients to repeat inscriptions in
this way.</p>

<p>The other staircases of this great platform are all more
or less decorated with sculptures and resemble that described;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
they lead to the different palaces, of which there
are three. The palaces are those of Darius, Xerxes, and
Artaxerxes Ochus, and besides these there are two great
pillared halls; one of these is called the "Hall of One
Hundred Columns," and the other <i>Chehl Minar</i>, or the
"Great Hall of Audience."</p>

<p>This view of the palace of Darius gives an idea of the
appearance of all these buildings. A description of them
would be only a wordy repetition of the characteristics of
one apartment and hall after another, and I shall leave
them to speak of the magnificent halls which are the glory
of the ruins of Persepolis, and the wonders of the world to
those who are acquainted with the architectural monuments
of the Turkish, Greek, Roman, Moorish, and Christian
nations. (See <a href="#illus026">Fig.&nbsp;26</a>.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 487px;"><img id="illus026" src="images/illus026.jpg" width="487" height="223" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 26.&mdash;Ruins of the Palace of Darius, Persepolis.</span></div></div>

<p>The Hall of a Hundred Columns was very splendid, as
one may judge from this picture of its gateway (<a href="#illus027">Fig.&nbsp;27</a>);
but the <i>Chehl Minar</i>, or Great Hall of Audience, which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
also called the Hall of Xerxes, was the most remarkable of
all these edifices. Its ruins occupy a space of almost three
hundred and fifty feet in length and two hundred and forty-six
feet in width, and consist principally of four different
kinds of columns. One portion of this hall was arranged
in a square, in which there were six rows of six pillars each,
and on three sides of this square there were magnificent
porches, in each of which there were twelve columns; so
that the number of pillars in the square was thirty-six, and
that of those in the three porches was the same. These
porches stood out boldly from the main building and were
grand in their effect.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 426px;"><img id="illus027" src="images/illus027.jpg" width="426" height="311" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 27.&mdash;Gateway of Hall of a Hundred Columns.</span></div></div>

<p>The columns which remain in various parts of this hall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
are so high that it is
thought that they must
originally have measured
sixty-four feet throughout
the whole building.
The capitals of the pillars were of
three kinds: the double Horned
Lion capital (<a href="#illus028">Fig.&nbsp;28</a>) was used in
the eastern porch, and was very
simple; in the western porch was
the double Bull capital, which corresponded
to the first in size and
general form, the difference being
only in the shape of the animal.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 202px;"><img id="illus028" src="images/illus028.jpg" width="202" height="144" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 28.&mdash;Double Horned Lion Capital.</span></div></div>

<p>The north porch faced the great
sculptured staircase, and was the
real front of the hall. On this side
the columns were much ornamented.
The following
plates show
the entire design
of them,
and it will be
seen that the
bases were very beautiful (Figs. <a href="#illus029">29</a> and
<a href="#illus030">30</a>).</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 145px;"><img id="illus029" src="images/illus029.jpg" width="145" height="345" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 29.&mdash;Complex Capital and Base of Pillars, Persepolis.</span></div></div>

<p>The capitals have three distinct parts;
at the bottom is a sort of bed of lotus
leaves, part of which are turned down,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
and the others standing up form a kind of cup on which the
next section above rests. The middle section is fluted and
has spiral scrolls or volutes, such as are seen in Ionic capitals,
only here they are in a perpendicular position instead
of the customary horizontal one. The upper portion had
the same double figures of bulls as were on the columns of
the western colonnade. The decoration on the bases was
made of two or three rows of hanging lotus leaves, some
round and others pointed in form. The shafts of these
pillars were formed
of different blocks
of stone joined by
iron cramps; they
were cut in exact
and regular flutings,
numbering
from forty-eight to
fifty-two on each
pillar.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 364px;"><img id="illus031" src="images/illus031.jpg" width="364" height="335" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 31.&mdash;Ground Plan (restored) of Hall of Xerxes, Persepolis.</span></div></div>

<p>This plan of the
Hall of Audience
will help you to
understand its arrangement
more
clearly (<a href="#illus031">Fig.&nbsp;31</a>).</p>

<p>The square with
the thirty-six columns, and the three porches with twelve
columns each, are distinctly marked. The most ornamental
pillars were on the side with the entrance or gateway. The
two small rooms on the ends of the main portico may have
been guard-rooms.</p>

<p>We can only regret that, while we know certain things
about this hall, there is still much of which we know nothing.
However, there are many theories concerning it.
Some authorities believe that it was roofed, while others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
think that it was open and protected only by curtains and
hangings, of which the Persians made much use. As we
cannot know positively about it, and Persepolis was the
spring residence of the Persian kings, it is pleasant to fancy
that this splendid pillared hall was a summer throne-room,
having beautiful hangings that could be drawn aside at will,
admitting all the spicy breezes of that sunny land, and
realizing the description of the palace of Shushan in the
Book of Esther, which says, "In the court of the garden
of the king's palace; where were white, green, and blue
hangings, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to
silver rings and pillars of marble; the beds were of gold
and silver, upon a pavement of red, and blue, and white,
and black marble."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 141px;"><img id="illus032" src="images/illus032.jpg" width="141" height="177" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 32.&mdash;Part of a Base of the Time of Cyrus, Pasargadæ.</span></div></div>

<p>Here the king could receive all those who sought him;
the glorious view of the plains of Susa and Persepolis, the
breezes which came to him laden with the odors of the
choicest flowers would soothe him to content, and realize
his full desire for that deep breath from open air which
gives a sense of freedom and power. We know that no
Oriental, be he monarch or slave, desires
to live beneath a roof or within
closed doors.</p>

<p>The column was in Persia developed
with a good deal of originality and
much artistic feeling; and one fine
base of the time of Cyrus is especially
interesting for its close resemblance to
the base of certain Ionic pillars afterward
made in Greece (<a href="#illus032">Fig.&nbsp;32</a>).</p>

<p>The tombs of the royal Persians were
usually hewn out of the solid rock;
the tomb of Cyrus, only, resembles a little house; this plate
gives a representation of it (<a href="#illus033">Fig.&nbsp;33</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 315px;"><img id="illus033" src="images/illus033.jpg" width="315" height="227" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 33.&mdash;The Tomb of Cyrus.</span></div></div>

<p>The one apartment in this tomb is about eleven feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
long, seven feet broad, and seven feet high; it has no
window, and a low, narrow doorway in one of the end walls
is the only entrance to it. Ancient writers say that the
body of Cyrus in a golden coffin was deposited in this
tomb.</p>

<p>Seven other tombs have been explored; they are excavations
in the sides of the mountains high enough to be
prominent objects to the sight, and yet difficult of approach.
The fronts of these tombs are much ornamented, and the
internal chambers are large; there are recesses for the
burial-cases, and these vary in number, some having only
space for three bodies. The tomb of Darius had three
recesses, in each of which there were three burial-cases; but
this was an unusually large number. The tombs near
Persepolis are the finest which have yet been examined.</p>

<p>The most noticeable characteristic of Persian architecture
is its regularity. The plans used are simple, and only
straight lines occur in them; thus, all the angles are right
angles. The columns are regularly placed, and the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
sides of an apartment or building correspond to each other.
The magnificent staircases, and the abundance of elegant
columns which have been called "groves of pillars" by
some writers, produced a grand and dignified effect. The
huge size of the blocks of stone used by Persian builders
gives an impression of great power in those who planned
their use, and demands for them the respect of all thoughtful
students of these edifices.</p>

<p>The faults of this architecture lay in the narrow doorways,
the small number of passages, and the clumsy thickness
of the walls. But these faults are insignificant in
comparison with its beauties, and it is all the more to be
admired that it was invented by the Persians, not copied
from other nations, and there is little doubt that the Greeks
profited by its study to improve their own style, and
through this study substituted lightness and elegance for
the clumsy and heavy effect of the earliest Grecian architecture.</p>

<h3>JUDEA.</h3>

<p>There is so much of religious, historical, romantic, and
poetical association with the land of Judea, that it is a disappointment
to know that there are no remains of Judean
architecture from which to study the early art-history of
that country; it is literally true that nothing remains.</p>

<p>The ruins of Jerusalem, Baalbec, Palmyra, Petra, and
places beyond the Jordan are not Jewish, but Roman remains.
The most interesting remnant is a passage and
gateway which belonged to the great temple at Jerusalem.
This passage is situated beneath the platform of the temple;
it is called "The Gateway Huldah." The width of it is
forty-one feet, and at one point there is a magnificent pillar,
called a monolith, because it is cut from a single stone.
This pillar supports four arches, which divide the passage
into as many compartments, each one of which has a flat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
dome. On these domes or roofs there were formerly
beautiful ornamental designs, one of which remains, and is
like this picture (<a href="#illus034">Fig.&nbsp;34</a>). Its combination of Oriental and
Roman design proves that it cannot be very old, but must
have been made after the influence of the Romans had been
felt in Judea.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 301px;"><img id="illus034" src="images/illus034.jpg" width="301" height="187" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 34.&mdash;Roof of One of the Compartments of the Gate Huldah.</span></div></div>

<p>Since the excavations in Assyria, and through the use of
the knowledge obtained there and in other ancient countries,
and by comparing this with the descriptions of the Bible
and the works of Josephus, some antiquarians have made
plans and drawings of what they believe that the temple at
Jerusalem must have been at the time of the Crucifixion.
The result of this work has little interest, for two reasons:
first, because we do not know that it is correct; second,
because even at the time to which it is ascribed, it was not
the ancient temple of Solomon. That had been destroyed,
and after the return of the Jews from the Captivity, was
rebuilt; again, it had been changed and restored by the
Romans under Herod, so that it had little in reality, or by
way of association, to give it the sacred and intense interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
for us which would belong to the true, ancient temple at
Jerusalem.</p>

<h3>GREECE.</h3>

<p>The earliest history of Greece is lost in what we may
call the Age of Legend. From that period have come to
us such marvellous stories of gods and goddesses, and all
sorts of wonderful happenings and doings, that even the
most serious and wise scholars can learn little about it, and
it remains to all alike a kind of delightful fairy-land.</p>

<p>Back to that remote age one can send his fancy and
imagination to feast upon the tales of wondrous bravery,
passionate love, dire revenge, and supernatural occurrences
of every sort until he is weary of it all. Then he is glad to
come back to his actual life, in which cause and effect are
so much more clearly seen, and which, if more matter-of-fact,
is more comfortable than the hap-hazard existence of
those remarkable beings who were liable to be changed into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
beasts, or trees, or almost anything else at a moment's
notice, or to be whisked away from the midst of their
families and friends and set down to starve in some desolate
place where there was nothing to eat, and no one to listen
to complaints of sorrow or hunger.</p>

<p>This legendary time in Grecian history begins nobody
knows when, and ends about one thousand years before the
birth of Christ. Our only knowledge of it comes from the
mythology which we have inherited from the past, and the
two poems of Homer, called the "Iliad" and the "Odyssey."</p>

<p>The "Iliad" recounts the anger of Achilles and all that
happened in the Trojan War; the "Odyssey" relates the
wonderful adventures of Ulysses. Probably Homer never
thought of such a thing as being an historian&mdash;he was a
poet&mdash;much less did he dream of being the only historian
of any certain time or age; but since, in the course of his
poems, he refers to the manners and customs of the years
that had preceded him, and gives accounts of certain past
events, he is, in truth, the prime source from which we
learn the little that we know of the prehistoric days in
Greece.</p>

<p>It is believed that Homer wrote about 850 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, and
after that date we have nothing complete in Greek literature
until the time of Herodotus, who is called the "Father
of History" and was born in 484 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> Thus four centuries
between Homer and Herodotus are left with no authoritative
writings.</p>

<p>The legendary or first period of Greek history was followed
by five hundred years more of which we have no continuous
history; but facts have been gathered here and
there from the works of various authors which make it possible
to give a reliable account of the Greece of that time.
For our purpose in this book we go on to a still later time,
or a third period, which began about 500 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, in which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
architecture and art which we have in mind, when we use
the general term Greek Art, originated.</p>

<p>It is true that before this temples had been erected of
which we have some knowledge, and the elegant and ornate
articles which Dr. Schliemann has found in his excavations
at Troy and Mycenæ prove that the art of that remote time
reached a high point of excellence. The temples and other
buildings of which we know anything, and which belonged
to the second period, were clumsy and rude when compared
with the perfection of the time which we propose to study.</p>

<p>Before we speak of any one edifice it is best to understand
something of the various orders of Greek architecture,
more especially as the terms which belong to it and
had their origin in it are now used in speaking of architecture
the world over, and from being first applied to Greek
art have grown to be general in their application.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 394px;"><img id="illus035" src="images/illus035.jpg" width="394" height="561" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 35.&mdash;Gravestone from Mycenæ (Schliemann).</span></div></div>

<p>In the most ancient days of Greece the royal fortresses
were the finest structures, but in later days the temple
became the supreme object upon which thought and labor
were lavished. The public buildings which served the uses
of the whole people were second in consideration, while the
private dwellings were of the least importance of all. The
Greek temple was built upon a raised
structure like those of Assyria and other
Oriental nations, but the Greek temple
was much smaller, and by a dignified and
simple elegance in detail, and a harmony
in all its parts, it expressed a more noble
religious sentiment than could be conveyed
by all the vast piles of massive
confusion that had abounded in more
Eastern lands.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 94px;"><img id="illus036" src="images/illus036.jpg" width="94" height="160" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 36.&mdash;Temple of Diana, Eleusis</span>.</div></div>

<p>The earliest and simplest Greek temples were merely
small, square chambers made to contain an image of a god,
and in later times, when the temples came to be splendid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
and grand, the apartment containing the sacred image was
still called the <i>cella</i> or cell, as it had been named from the
first. The simplest form of temple was like the little cut
(<a href="#illus036">Fig.&nbsp;36</a>), and had two pillars in the centre of the front
and two square pilasters at the front end of the side walls.
These pilasters are called <i>antæ</i>, and the whole style of the
building is called <i>distyle in antis</i>; the word distyle denotes
the two pillars, and the expression means two pillars with
antæ.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 363px;"><img id="illus037" src="images/illus037.jpg" width="363" height="365" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 37.&mdash;Small Temple at Rhamnus.</span></div></div>

<p>The above picture shows the next advance that was
made in form (<a href="#illus037">Fig.&nbsp;37</a>). A porch was added to the cell,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
the two parts being separated by a wall with a doorway
in it. After a time the number of pillars in front was increased
to six, and the two outer ones were the first of a
row which extended along the entire length
of the sides of the temple, thus forming a
peristyle, or a row of columns entirely around
the cell; the cell itself remained, according
to the original plan, in the centre of the
building. The ground plan of such a temple
is given in the next wood-cut (<a href="#illus038">Fig.&nbsp;38</a>).</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 100px;"><img id="illus038" src="images/illus038.jpg" width="100" height="251" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 38&mdash;Plan of Temple of Apollo, Bassæ.</span></div></div>

<p>A large proportion of the Greek temples
were built in this manner, and were called
<i>hexastyle</i> from the six columns on the front.</p>

<p>The different orders of ancient Greek
architecture are called the Doric, the Ionic,
and the Corinthian. The Greeks were very
fond of the Doric order, and used it so
extensively as to make it almost exclusively their own.
The picture of the Parthenon will help you to understand
the explanations of the characteristics of the Doric order
(<a href="#illus039">Fig.&nbsp;39</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 499px;"><img id="illus039" src="images/illus039.jpg" width="499" height="302" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 39&mdash;The Parthenon.</span> <i>Athens</i>. (<span class="smcap">Restored.</span>)</div></div>

<p>As you see, the pillars had no base, but rested directly
on the upper plinth of the foundation of the building. The
shaft of the column is cut in flutings, and the number of
them varies from sixteen to twenty; the latter number being
most frequently used. The capital of the column is divided
into two portions; the lower one is called the <i>echinus</i>, and
projects beyond the shaft and supports a square tile or
block which is called the <i>abacus</i>, and this is the architectural
name for the upper member of all capitals to columns.
The <i>architrave</i> or principal beam above these columns rests
directly on the capitals and runs around the building. This
architrave is made of separate blocks of marble or stone,
and is finished at the top by a small strip of the same
materials, which is called a <i>tenia</i>. This cut, which gives a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
section of the Parthenon on a larger scale than the last
picture, will enable you to find the different portions more
easily (<a href="#illus040">Fig.&nbsp;40</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 416px;"><img id="illus040" src="images/illus040.jpg" width="416" height="437" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 40.&mdash;From the Parthenon, Athens.</span></div></div>

<p>Above the architrave and resting on it is the <i>frieze</i>; this
is ornamented with fluted spaces called <i>triglyphs</i>, because
they are cut in three flutings. The spaces between the
triglyphs are called <i>metopes</i>, and sometimes left plain, and
sometimes ornamented with sculptures, as is the case in the
frieze of the Parthenon. Under the triglyphs six little
blocks, or drops, are placed so that they lay over the architrave.
Above the frieze there is another narrow strip, or
tenia, like that upon the architrave. Above all this rests
the <i>cornice</i>, and underneath the cornice are one or more
rows of the small, drop-like blocks such as make the lower
finish of the triglyphs; in the lower band of the cornice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
separate blocks are placed over each triglyph and each
metope, with a small space between.</p>

<p>It is important to know that the architrave, frieze, and
cornice, all taken together, form what is called the <i>entablature</i>;
and the entablature occupies the whole of the broad
space between the top of the capitals of the pillars and the
lower edge of the roof.</p>

<p>The triangular space formed by the sloping of the roof
upon the ends of a building is called the <i>pediment</i>, and, as
you will see in the picture of the Parthenon, its pediment
was ornamented with elaborate sculptures which are spoken
of in the volume of this series which is devoted to that art.
It was customary to thus ornament the pediment and to
paint the walls of the cella and other portions of the building,
so that while the pure Doric style seems at first sight
to be stiff and straight in its effect, it becomes rich and
ornamental by the use of sculpture and painting, and yet
remains solid and stable.</p>

<p>The Doric style may be regarded as a native growth in
Greece, as almost every detail of its construction and its
ornaments may be traced back to the early wooden buildings
of the people, as the architecture of the tombs of Beni-Hassan
had been. The triglyphs, for instance, represent
the ends of the beams upon which the rafters rested, while
the bas-reliefs between took the place of the votive offerings
which in the primitive temples were placed in the open
spaces between the beams. It is not necessary here to go
into all the particulars of this resemblance, which perhaps
learned men have sometimes carried too far, and which are
rather difficult to understand; it is enough to say that there
are excellent reasons for regarding the theory as, upon the
whole, sound, although, of course, the Grecian architects
modified and enriched the forms which the simple timber
work had suggested.</p>

<p>The next great order was called the Ionic, and has a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
close relation with certain
forms found in Asia
Minor. This picture of
an Ionic capital and entablature
is taken from
the Temple of Athena
at Priene (<a href="#illus041">Fig.&nbsp;41</a>). Its
scroll-like capital recalls
those of the pillars in
the Great Hall of Xerxes
at Persepolis, shown in
Figs. <a href="#illus028">28</a> and <a href="#illus029">29</a>, and
many examples of even
closer resemblance might
be given. The order
differed from the Doric
principally in the ornamentation
of its capitals
and in the fact that the
columns have bases. These cuts show different kinds of
bases belonging to the Ionic order. The first is from the
temple at Priene (<a href="#illus042">Fig.&nbsp;42</a>),
and the second is the form
known as the Attic base (<a href="#illus043">Fig.&nbsp;43</a>). The third is especially
interesting from its close resemblance
to the ancient Persian
base shown in <a href="#illus032">Fig.&nbsp;32</a>,
and is another illustration of
the Eastern origin of this order
(<a href="#illus044">Fig.&nbsp;44</a>).</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 130px;"><img id="illus044" src="images/illus044.jpg" width="130" height="282" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 44.&mdash;Base from Temple of Hera, Samos.</span></div></div>

<p>The Ionic capital is very
easily recognized by its spiral
projections, or scrolls, which
are called volutes (<a href="#illus045">Fig.&nbsp;45</a>).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
These are so placed that they present a flat surface on the
opposite sides of the capital, like the picture below (<a href="#illus046">Fig.&nbsp;46</a>); sometimes the volutes are finished
by a rosette in the centre.</p>

<p>The shaft of the Ionic column is
sometimes plain and sometimes fluted;
the flutings number twenty-four,
and are separated by a narrow, plain
band or fillet. In some ancient examples
of the Ionic order the entire
entablature is left plain, but in many
instances there are bands of carvings,
as in the first Ionic example given
above; in some modern Italian
architecture even more ornament
has been added.</p>

<p>The three, or sometimes two,
layers or bands of stone which form
the Ionic
architrave
project a little,
each one
more than the other, and the ornamented
band above it serves to separate
it from
the frieze so
as to make
these two portions of the entablature
quite distinct from each other.
The frieze is never divided into set
spaces as in the Doric order, but
when ornamented has a continuous
design in relief.</p>

<p>The lower part of the cornice is frequently cut in little
pieces or dentals which form what is called the "tooth-like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
ornament;" these have the effect of hanging from underneath
the cornice. There is a certain pleasing effect in
Ionic architecture which, perhaps, appeals to our taste at
first sight more forcibly than does the severe elegance of
the Doric order. Nevertheless, the latter is a higher type
of art, and it is not probable that it can ever be superseded
by any new invention or
lose the prestige which
it has held so long.</p>

<p>That which is called
the Corinthian order
differs very little from
the Ionic except in the
capital, but as this was
so prominent a member
of the Ionic style, the
difference seems greater
than it really is. It is
therefore not necessary
to speak of its parts in
detail. The Choragic
Monument of Lysicrates
at Athens is as good a
specimen of the order as
remains at this time, and
of this we give an illustration
(<a href="#illus047">Fig.&nbsp;47</a>).</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 154px;"><img id="illus048" src="images/illus048.jpg" width="154" height="263" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 48.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Corinthian Order.</span></div></div>

<p>The Corinthian order of architecture does not belong to
the early period of art in Greece. It came after the influence
of Oriental architecture had been shown in the Ionic
style; and perhaps the beautiful Corinthian capital may
have been suggested by the palm-leaf and lotus capitals of
Egypt. What has been said of other orders will help you
in understanding this; but I shall tell you especially about
its capital, as that is its distinguishing feature. The form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
of the capital may be called bell-shaped, and it is set round
with two rows of leaves, eight in each row; above these is
a third row of leaves, or of a sort of small twisted husks,
which supports eight small volutes. The abacus or top
portion of the capital is cut out at the corners so that sharp
projections are made, called horns, and one volute comes
directly under each horn of the abacus. This cut (<a href="#illus048">Fig.&nbsp;48</a>)
gives a more distinct idea of the
capital than does that above, and
you will see that four of the volutes
really form the upper corners
of the capital. The four other
volutes meet on two opposite sides
of the capital; sometimes they
are interwoven, and a flower, or
rosette, or some other ornament
is placed above them and lays up
over the abacus. Different kinds
of leaves are used in making this
capital; olive, water plant, and
acanthus are all thus employed;
there is a very pretty legend as
to its origin which makes the
acanthus seem to be the only one
which belongs to it, and is as
follows:</p>

<p>It was the custom in Greece to place a basket upon the
new-made graves in which were the viands which those
there buried had preferred when in life. About 550 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> a
lovely virgin died at Corinth, and her nurse arranged the
basket with care and covered it with a tile. It happened
that the basket was set directly over a young acanthus
plant, and the leaves grew up about it in such a manner
that the sculptor Callimachus was attracted by its grace and
beauty, and conceived the idea of using it as a model for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
new capital in architecture. I have always been sorry that
it was not named for the beautiful maiden rather than for
the city in which she was buried.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 60px;"><img id="illus049" src="images/illus049.jpg" width="60" height="278" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 49.&mdash;Caryatid.</span></div></div>

<p>Another feature of Greek architecture is the
use of the Caryatid, or a human figure standing
upon a base and supporting the capital of
a column upon the head, or, to put it more
plainly, a human figure serving as the shaft to
a column. These figures are usually females,
and this picture of one from the Erechtheium
at Athens shows how they are placed (<a href="#illus049">Fig.&nbsp;49</a>). Sometimes the figures of giants, called
<i>Telamones</i>, were used in the same way.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 187px;"><img id="illus050" src="images/illus050.jpg" width="187" height="242" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 50.&mdash;Stool, or Chair, Khorsabad.</span></div></div>

<p>In Oriental art such figures are numerous;
they are used to support platforms and the
thrones of
kings; their position
is sometimes
varied by
making the uplifted
hands
bear the weight
instead of the head (<a href="#illus050">Fig.&nbsp;50</a>).
In any case this feature in
architecture is tiresome, and
its use is certainly questionable
as a matter of good taste.</p>

<p>Having given a general
outline of the characteristics
of Greek architecture, I will
speak of some remarkable
edifices which are beautiful
in themselves and have an
interest for us on account of their associations with the
history of the world, as well as with that of art.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
The Temple of Diana at Ephesus, of which nothing
now remains, was the largest and most splendid of all the
Greek temples. It was four hundred and twenty-five feet
long by two hundred and twenty wide.</p>

<p>The ancients counted this temple as one of the Seven
Wonders of the World, and when we know that its pillars
were sixty feet high, and that the beams of the architrave
which had to be lifted up above the pillars to be put in
place were each thirty feet long, we can readily understand
that the building of it was a wonderful work. This was not
the first temple that had stood on the same spot, for we
know that one had been burned on the night in which Alexander
the Great was born, 356 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> It was set on fire by
Herostratus; he was tried for this crime and was put to
the torture to make him declare his motive for doing such
a dreadful deed; he gave as his only reason his desire to
have his name handed down through all ages, and he
believed that by burning the temple he should accomplish
his object&mdash;as, indeed, he did, for every historian repeats the
story of his crime, and his name stands as a synonym for
wicked ambition.</p>

<p>After this destruction the temple was rebuilt on a most
magnificent scale, and was not finished until two hundred
and twenty years had passed. Diana was a great and
powerful goddess, and all the nations of Asia united in gifts
for the adornment of her shrine; the women even gave
their personal ornaments to be sold to increase the fund to
be spent upon it.</p>

<p>This temple was four times as large as the Parthenon at
Athens, and had one hundred and twenty-seven splendid
columns, thirty-six of which were finely carved and were
the gifts of various sovereigns. The grand staircase was
made from the wood of a single Cyprian vine. But great
as was the temple itself, its adornments of statues by the
sculptor Praxiteles, and the vast treasures of ornaments and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
rare objects by which it was enriched made it even more
famous. The Temple of Diana was robbed by Nero and
burned by the Goths, but its final destruction probably
occurred after <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 381, when the Emperor Theodosius I.
issued an edict forbidding all the ceremonies of the pagan
worship.</p>

<p>Many beautiful objects were taken away to adorn the
mediæval churches of other religions than that of the
Ephesians. Some of its green jasper columns were used to
support the dome of St. Sophia at Constantinople, and
other parts of it are seen in the cathedrals of Italy.</p>

<p>There is scarcely a more desolate spot in the world than
is the Ephesus of to-day. No remaining ruins are so preserved
as to afford the visitor any satisfaction. The
marbles and stone have been used to build other towns,
which in their turn have been destroyed. The inhabitants
are a handful of poor Greek peasants; wolves and jackals
from the neighboring mountains roam about; and though
an abundance of myrtle and some lovely groves relieve the
gloominess of the scene, it is impossible when there to re-create
in imagination the splendid Ephesian city, with its
wharves and docks, its temples, theatres, and palaces,
which were so famous as to cause it to be spoken of with
wonder throughout the ancient world.</p>

<p>We often hear of the glory of the Periclean age at
Athens, and it is true that under the leadership of Pericles
Athens reached its greatest prosperity. This picture shows
the Acropolis as it appeared at that time (<a href="#illus051">Fig.&nbsp;51</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 551px;"><img id="illus051" src="images/illus051.jpg" width="551" height="343" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 51.&mdash;The Acropolis.</span> <i>Athens.</i> (<span class="smcap">Restored.</span>)</div></div>

<p>In these best days of Athens the whole Acropolis was
consecrated to religious worship and ceremonials, and its
entire extent was occupied by temples and statues of the
gods. The fact that I have before mentioned, that the
religion of a country moulds its art, is especially true of the
art of Greece; figures of the gods and bas-reliefs of the
ceremonies of the Grecian worship form a large and most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
important part of the work of the Greek artists, and the
splendid temples were raised to be the sacred homes of
the statues of the great gods, to which the people could
come with offerings and prayers.</p>

<p>The Acropolis was also a sort of fortress, because it was
an eminence, and its sides of craggy rock allowed of but
one ascent; thus it could be easily defended. Then, when
all the wonders and riches of art had been collected there,
the pure white marble, the sculpture and painting, and the
ornaments of shining metals which glistened in the sun,
while brilliant colors added their rich effect, it might be
called a gorgeous museum, such as has never since been
equalled in the history of the world.</p>

<p>It is important to know that the Athenians worshipped
three different goddesses, all called by the one name of
Athene or Athena. The most ancient and most sacred of
these was Athena Polias, whose statue, made of olive-wood,
was believed to have fallen from heaven. The Erechtheium
was dedicated to this goddess, and there this holy, heaven-sent
figure was kept, with other sacred objects of which I
shall speak in their place.</p>

<p>The Athena next in importance was the goddess of the
Parthenon, or the "House of the Virgin," as the word
signifies, for this Athena Parthenos is the same as the
goddess Minerva, who is said never to have married or
known the sentiment of love; she was the goddess of war,
prudence, and wisdom. The third Athena was called
Promachos, which means the champion. Phidias made of
her one of his splendid statues, standing erect, with helmet,
spear, and shield.</p>

<p>In describing the Acropolis we shall begin with the
Propylæa, or the entrances, which occupy the centre of
our picture and to which the steps lead, showing the passage
between the pillars, three being left on each side.
This magnificent series of entrances&mdash;as the whole ascent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
from the outer gate in the wall, up the steps, and through
the passage between the pillars may be called&mdash;was erected
about 437 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, and cost two thousand talents of gold,
which is equal to about two millions of our dollars. The
fame of the Propylæa was world-wide, and together with
the Parthenon it was considered the architectural glory of
the Periclean age. The style in which they are built is a
splendid example of the combination of the Doric and the
Ionic orders, for while the exterior is almost pure Doric,
the interior is made more cheerful by the use of the Ionic
columns and ornamentation.</p>

<p>High up at the right of the picture stands the Parthenon.
Its architecture, which is Doric, has been described. We
do not know when this temple was begun, but it is probably
on the site of an older one. It was finished 438 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, and
the general care of its erection was given to Phidias, the
most famous of all sculptors. The marble of which the
Parthenon was built was pure Pentelic, and as it rested on
a rude basement of limestone the contrast between the two
made the marble of the temple seem all the finer. Within
and without this temple abounded in magnificent sculptures
executed by Phidias himself or under his orders.</p>

<p>The Erechtheium, which is only partly visible at the
back on the left of the picture, was the most sacred temple
of Athens. It was the burial-place of Erechtheus, who
was regarded not only as the founder of this temple, but
also of the religion of Athena in Athens. Beside the
heaven-descended statue of Athena Polias which was kept
here, there was the sacred olive-tree which Athena had
called forth from the earth when she was contending for the
possession of Attica; here, too, was the well of salt water
which Poseidon (or Neptune) made by striking the spot
with his trident, and several other sacred objects (<a href="#illus052">Fig.&nbsp;52</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 441px;"><img id="illus052" src="images/illus052.jpg" width="441" height="291" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 52.&mdash;The Erechtheium.</span> <i>Athens.</i> (<span class="smcap">Restored.</span>)</div></div>

<p>This beautiful temple was built in the Ionic style, and
is very interesting because it is so different in form from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
every other Greek temple of which we know. This is
partly due to the fact that it was built where the ground
was not level, one portion of it being eight feet higher than
another. A second reason for its irregularity may be that
it required to be divided into more cells or apartments than
other Greek temples in order to arrange the different sacred
objects within its walls. A very considerable portion of
this temple is still standing. The frieze, of which but little
remains, was of black marble, upon which there were figures
in white marble.</p>

<p>The Erechtheium is certainly a splendid example of the
Attic-Ionic style, and the eye rests upon it with admiration;
but its half-pillars and caryatides, its various porches
and luxuriant detail of form and ornament, are less effective
as a whole than is the Parthenon in its pure Doric
architecture.</p>

<p>An interesting fact about Greek architecture is that the
marbles used were painted in high colors. There is a
theory, which may or may not be true, that the custom first
arose in the same way as the shape of the Doric entablature,
from the imitation of wooden buildings. The wood
was painted to preserve it, and when stone began to be substituted,
the architects, accustomed to bright effects, colored
the marbles to look like wood. Whether this is the true
origin of the custom or not, it is certain that the custom
prevailed. The lower parts of the pillars of a Doric temple
were usually stained a light golden-brown tint; the
triglyphs and the mutules, or brackets beneath the cornices,
were a rich blue; the trunnels, or wooden pins, were red or
gilded; the metopes had a dark red background, against
which the bas-reliefs with which they were ornamented
stood out in strong contrast, while the frieze and cornice
were richly painted with garlands and leaves. So highly
colored a building would seem less out of place amid the
varied landscape of Greece than under our colder skies, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
it is difficult for us to form any just idea of the splendid
appearance it must have presented.</p>

<p>One of the most wonderful things about Greek architecture
is the way in which allowance was made for the deception
of the eye by certain forms and lines. It is not easy
to explain this fully, but it is too remarkable to be wholly
passed over. If a column were cut so as to diminish regularly
from the bottom to the top it would seem to the eye
to hollow in, and to correct this the clever Greek architect
made his columns swell out a little at the middle. This is
called <i>entasis</i>, and is the best known of the means taken to
make forms look as they should. Another case is that of
long horizontal lines. If they are really level they appear
to sag at the centre, therefore in Greek temples they are
delicately rounded up a little, and so have the effect of
being perfectly straight. These two examples may serve
to show what I mean by saying that architectural forms
were made one way so as to look another, and in nothing
did the Greek architecture show more marvellous skill and
taste than in this.</p>

<p>In other Grecian cities the architecture differed but little
from that of Athens, and, indeed, the influence of Athenian
art and artists was felt all over the Eastern world; it is
therefore not necessary for our purpose to speak further of
Greek temples.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 172px;"><img id="illus053" src="images/illus053.jpg" width="172" height="395" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 53.&mdash;Choragic Monument of Lysicrates.</span> <i>Athens.</i></div></div>

<p>Next in importance were the municipal buildings, of
which we find but few traces at Athens. The monument of
Lysicrates is so beautiful that it gives us a most exalted idea
of what the taste in such edifices must have been (<a href="#illus053">Fig.&nbsp;53</a>).</p>

<p>This monument was erected in the year 334 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> when
Lysicrates was <i>choragus</i>; this officer provided the chorus
for the plays represented at Athens for the year. It was
expensive to hold this position, and its duties were
arduous; the choragus had to find the men for the chorus,
bring them together, and have them instructed in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
music, and also provide proper food for them while they
studied. It was customary to present a tripod to the
<i>choragus</i> who provided the finest musical entertainment,
and also to build a monument
upon which the tripod was
placed as a lasting honor to
him who had received it.
There was a street at Athens
called the "Street of the
Tripods" because it passed a
line of choragic monuments.
These monuments were dedicated
to different gods; this
of Lysicrates was devoted to
Bacchus, and was decorated
with sculptures representing
scenes in the story of that
god, who was regarded as the
patron of plays and theatres;
indeed, the Greek drama originated
in the choruses which
were sung at his festivals.</p>

<p>The Greek theatres were
very large and fine; the seats
were ranged in a half circle, but
as none remain in a sufficient
state of preservation to afford
a satisfactory picture, it would
be impossible to give a clear
description of them here.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 397px;"><img id="illus054" src="images/illus054.jpg" width="397" height="388" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 54.&mdash;The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus (Restored).</span></div></div>

<p>The ancient Greeks were not tomb-builders, and we
know little of their burial-places. However, the Mausoleum
built at Halicarnassus by Artemisia, in memory of her
husband, Mausolus, was so important as to be numbered
among the seven wonders of the world (<a href="#illus054">Fig.&nbsp;54</a>).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
Mausolus was the King of Caria, of which country Halicarnassus
was the chief city. He died about 353 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, and
his wife, Artemisia, gradually faded away with sorrow at
his death, and survived him but two years. But during
this time she had commenced the erection of the Mausoleum,
and the artists to whom she intrusted the work were
as faithful in completing it as though she had lived, for the
sake of their own fame as artists. This magnificent tomb
may be described as an example of architecture as a fine art<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
exclusively, for it cannot be said to have been useful, since
the body of Mausolus was burned according to custom, and
certainly a much smaller tomb would have been sufficient
for the remaining ashes.</p>

<p>The whole height of the Mausoleum was one hundred
and forty feet; the north and south aisles were sixty-three
feet long, and the others a little less. The burial vault was
at the base, and the whole mass above it was ornamented
with magnificent designs splendidly executed. Above the
whole was a quadriga, or four-horse chariot, in which it is
said that a figure of Mausolus was placed so that from land
or sea it could be seen at a great distance. It is not strange
that this tomb was called a wonder in its day, and from it
we still take our word "mausoleum" for all burial-places
which merit so distinguished a name.</p>

<p>Writers of the twelfth century speak of the beauty of
this tomb, but in <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 1402, when the Knights of St. John
took possession of Halicarnassus, it no longer remained,
and a castle was built upon its site. The tomb had been
buried, probably by an earthquake, and the name of the
place was then changed to Boodroom.</p>

<p>In the year 1522 some sculptures were found there, but
it was not until 1856 that Mr. Newton, an Englishman, discovered
that these remains had belonged to the Mausoleum.
A large collection of reliefs, statues, and other objects,
more or less imperfect, was taken to London and placed in
the British Museum, where they are known as the "Halicarnassus
Sculptures."</p>

<p>As other temples were influenced by the example of the
Athenian builders, so many other tombs resembled that of
Mausolus in greater or less degree, although none approached
it in grandeur and magnificence.</p>

<p>Of the domestic architecture of the Greeks we know
very little. Almost all that is said of it is chiefly speculation,
as even the descriptions of Grecian palaces and houses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
which are given by the classic writers are imperfect. The
life of the Greek was passed largely in public, at the temple,
the theatre, or the baths, or at least in the open air, and
comparatively little attention was given to the building of
the private houses; but in the ruins of the temples and
other monuments which still exist we have sufficient proof
that no art has surpassed that of ancient Greece in purity,
elegance, and grandeur of style.</p>

<h3>ETRURIA.</h3>

<p>Since the Etruscans were an earlier Italian nation than
the Romans, and Rome, in her primal days, was ruled by
Etruscan kings, it is here fitting to speak of this remarkable
old people.</p>

<p>As Rome increased the Etruscans disappeared, and the
younger power came to have so mighty an influence in the
world that it absorbed the consideration of all nations as
much as if no other had ever ruled in Italy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
No Etruscan temple now remains, but we know that
they were not splendid like those of Greece. They were of
two forms, one being circular and dedicated to a single
deity, while others were devoted to three gods and had
three cells; their walls were built at right angles, thus
making their shape regular.</p>

<p>The theatres and amphitheatres of the Etruscans were
nearly circular and much like those of the later Italians, but
not one remains except that at Sutri, which, being cut in
the rock, does not afford a good example of the usual
arrangement of these edifices.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 266px;"><img id="illus055" src="images/illus055.jpg" width="266" height="216" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 55.&mdash;Tombs at Castel d'asso.</span></div></div>

<p>In fact, the only important remains of Etruscan architecture
are the tombs, of which there are many. These
are of two kinds; the first
are cut in the rocks and resemble
the Egyptian tombs
at Beni-Hassan, reminding
one of little houses (<a href="#illus055">Fig.&nbsp;55</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 257px;"><img id="illus056" src="images/illus056.jpg" width="257" height="349" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 56.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Principal Chamber in Regulini-Galeassi Tomb.</span></div></div>

<p>The second and most
numerous class are mounds
of earth raised above a wall
at the base. These were
called "Tumuli," and some
of them had fine, well-furnished
apartments in their
midst. The next cut shows
such a room as it appeared
when first opened; in it were found bedsteads, biers, shields,
arrows, a variety of vessels, and several kinds of useful
utensils (<a href="#illus056">Fig.&nbsp;56</a>).</p>

<p>These tombs are in
truth more connected
with other arts than
with architecture, and
many beautiful articles
have been found in
them. The most interesting
feature of Etruscan
architecture is the
arch, which was first
brought into general
use by the Romans, but
is found in Etruscan remains
(<a href="#illus057">Fig.&nbsp;57</a>), both in the semi-circular and pointed forms.
The principle of the arch had been known to several Oriental
nations, but it had been applied only to short spaces and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
comparatively unimportant uses, such as windows and
doorways (<a href="#illus058">Fig.&nbsp;58</a>).</p>

<p>There is no doubt that many of the earliest works of the
Romans were executed under the direction of Etruscan
architects. Among these was the great Cloaca Maxima, or
principal drain of ancient Rome. This was a wonderful
achievement; it is probable that the oldest arch in Europe
is that of this sewer, and the fact of its still remaining
proves how well it must have been built in order to last so
long (<a href="#illus059">Fig.&nbsp;59</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 243px;"><img id="illus059" src="images/illus059.jpg" width="243" height="187" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 59.&mdash;Arch of Cloaca Maxima.</span> <i>Rome.</i></div></div>

<h3>ROME.</h3>

<p>The early works of Rome, which were largely executed
by the Etruscans, were principally those useful, semi-architectural
objects necessary in the making of a city, such as
aqueducts and bridges. These belong quite as much to
civil engineering as to architecture, and we shall not speak
of them.</p>

<p>In studying Roman architecture one is surprised at the
number of uses to which it was applied, for not only do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
the temples, tombs, theatres, and monuments such as we
have found in other countries exist in Rome, but there are
also basilicas, baths, palaces, triumphal arches, pillars of
victory, fountains, and
various other objects
suited to the wants of
a great people.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 229px;"><img id="illus060" src="images/illus060.jpg" width="229" height="372" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 60.&mdash;Composite Order, from the Arch of Septimius Severus.</span> <i>Rome.</i></div></div>

<p>No truly pure,
national order of architecture
existed at
Rome. The union of
the arch of the Etruscans
with the columns
of the Greeks enabled
the Romans to change
the forms of their edifices
and to produce a
great variety in them.
They employed the
Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian
orders, but
they rarely used one
of these alone; they
united them in endless
combinations, and introduced
a capital of
the order which is
called the Composite
(<a href="#illus060">Fig.&nbsp;60</a>). It consists
of the lower part of the Corinthian and the upper part of
the Ionic capital; this was very rich in ornament, but the
line where the two orders were joined was always a defect,
and it never came into general favor.</p>

<p>The Romans also introduced what is called the Tuscan
order, which is usually mentioned with the Doric, Ionic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
Corinthian, and Composite, as being one of the five classic
orders of architecture, although it is really little more than
a variety of the Doric, as the Composite is of the Corinthian
order. It differed from the Doric in having a base, while
its frieze was simple and unadorned, the cornice also being
very plain. The shaft of the Tuscan column was never
fluted.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 179px;"><img id="illus061" src="images/illus061.jpg" width="179" height="199" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 61.</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Doric Arcade.</span></div></div>

<p>The Romans also used an arcade which was a combination
of Greek and Etruscan art, like this cut (<a href="#illus061">Fig.&nbsp;61</a>); thus
showing a power of adapting forms which already existed
in new combinations and for
new purposes, rather than an
originative genius.</p>

<p>A very important advance
made by the Romans was the
improvement of interior architecture.
The halls and portions
of edifices to be used
were more cared for than ever
before; this was sometimes
done at the expense of the
exteriors, to which the Greeks
had devoted all their thought.
In fact, many ancient Roman
temples were inferior to other
edifices which they built. The Pantheon is the only one
existing in such a state as to be spoken of with satisfaction.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 406px;"><img id="illus062" src="images/illus062.jpg" width="406" height="528" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 62.&mdash;Ground-plan of Pantheon.</span> <i>Rome.</i></div></div>

<p>This ground-plan (<a href="#illus062">Fig.&nbsp;62</a>) shows that the Pantheon is
circular with a porch. Taken separately, the rotunda and
the porch are each fine in their own way, but the joining
of the circular and angular forms has an effect of unfitness
which one cannot forget even when looking at that which
we regard with reverent interest. The central portion was
at first a part of the Baths of Agrippa, but on account of
its great beauty it was changed by Agrippa himself into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
a temple, by the addition of a row of Corinthian columns
around the interior. (See <a href="#illus063">Fig.&nbsp;63</a>.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 385px;"><img id="illus063" src="images/illus063.jpg" width="385" height="319" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 63.&mdash;Interior of the Pantheon.</span></div></div>

<p>Taken all in all, the effect of the Pantheon is that of
grandeur and simplicity. When we remember that sixteen
hundred and eighty-eight years have passed since it was
repaired by Septimius Severus, we wonder at its good preservation,
though we know that it has been robbed of its
bronze covering and other fine ornaments. An inscription
still remaining on its portico states that Marcus Aurelius
and Septimius Severus repaired this temple; history says
that Hadrian restored it after a fire, probably about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
year 117, and it is even said that Agrippa, who died <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span>&nbsp;13,
added the portico to a rotunda which existed before his
time.</p>

<p>The objects now in the interior of the Pantheon are so
largely modern that they do not belong to this portion of
our subject, but there is much interest associated with this
spot, and it is dear to all the world as the burial-place of
Raphael, Annibale Caracci, and other great artists.</p>

<p>Next to the temples of Rome came the Basilicas, of
which there were many before the time of Constantine.
The word basilica means the royal house, and these edifices
were first intended for a court-room in which the king
administered his laws; later they became markets, or places
of exchange, where men met for business transactions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
The ruins of the Basilicas of Trajan and Maxentius, two of
the finest of these edifices, are in such condition that their
plans can be understood (<a href="#illus064">Fig.&nbsp;64</a>). They were large, and
divided into aisles by rows of columns; at one end there was
a semi-circular recess or apse, in which was a raised platform,
approached by steps, also semi-circular in form. Upon this
platform the king or other exalted officer had his place,
while those of lesser rank were on the steps below, on either
side. Fronting the apse was an altar upon which sacrifices
were offered before commencing any important business.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 520px;"><img id="illus064" src="images/illus064.jpg" width="520" height="244" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 64.</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Longitudinal Section of Basilica of Maxentius.</span></div></div>

<p>The principal reason for speaking of basilicas is that by
the above cut you may see the great change made in architecture
about this time by the use of columns, only half the
height of the building, which were united by arches. This
was a very important step, and is, in truth, one of the
principal features that mark the progress of the change
from ancient to Gothic architecture&mdash;a change not fully
developed until the twelfth century.</p>

<p>I shall not say much of the theatres, amphitheatres, and
baths of ancient Rome, because it is not easy to treat them
in the simple manner suited to this book; they were magnificent
and costly, and made an important part of Roman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
architecture; they were probably copied from the public
buildings of the Etruscans.</p>

<p>Marcus Scaurus built a theatre in 58 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> which held
eighty thousand spectators; it had rich columns and
statues, and was decorated with gold, silver, and ivory.
The first stone theatre in Rome was built in 55 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, and
was only half the size of that of Marcus Scaurus. Parts of
the theatre of Marcellus still remain in the present Orsini
Palace in Rome, and serve to give an idea of the architecture
of the period immediately before the birth of Christ.</p>

<p>The Emperor Augustus boasted that he had found a
city of brick and had changed it to one of marble, but after
his time architecture suffered a decline, and its second
flourishing period may be dated from <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 69. To this
time belongs the Colosseum, also called the Flavian Amphitheatre;
it covers about five acres of ground, and is sufficiently
well preserved for a good idea to be formed of what
it must have been when in its best estate. The enormous
size of these ancient Roman edifices is almost too much for
us to imagine, and the most extensive of them all were the
<i>Thermæ</i>, or public baths.</p>

<p>The Baths of Diocletian, built <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 303, were the largest
of all; they had seats for twenty-four hundred bathers.
These baths were in reality a group of spacious halls of
varied forms, but all magnificent in size. The great hall of
the Baths of Diocletian was three hundred and fifty feet
long by eighty feet in width and ninety-six feet high; it
was converted into a church by Michael Angelo and is
called S. Maria Degli Angeli, or Holy Mary of the Angels.
Many splendid pictures which were once in St. Peter's are
now in this church, and copies of them made in mosaic fill
the places where they were originally hung.</p>

<p>The Baths of Caracalla were built in <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 217, and
though they had seats for but sixteen hundred bathers, they
were much more splendid than the Baths of Diocletian.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
They were surrounded by pleasure gardens, porticoes, and
a stadium or race-course, where all sorts of games were
held. Some beautiful mosaic pavements have been taken
from these baths, and are now in the Lateran and the Villa
Borghese palaces; there was a Pinacotica, or Fine Art
Gallery here, in which were some of the greatest art treasures
of the world, such as the Farnese Hercules, the
Farnese Bull, the two Gladiators, and other famous statues,
besides cameos, bronzes, and sculptures, almost without
end. The granite basins in the Piazza Farnese, and some
green basalt urns now in the Vatican Museum, were taken
from the Baths of Caracalla, and, indeed, all over Rome
there are objects of more or less beauty which were found
here.</p>

<p>Formerly the site of these baths was like a beautiful
Eden where Nature made herself happy in luxuriant
growths of all lovely things. The poet Shelley was very
fond of going there, and wrote of it, "Among the flowery
glades and thickets of odoriferous blossoming trees, which
are extended in ever-winding labyrinths upon its immense
platforms and dizzy arches suspended in the air," by which
we know that the ruins were covered with a soil which was
fruitful in flowers, vines, and trees; but all these have been
torn away in order to make the excavations which were
necessary for the exploration of these wonderful baths, and
now the parts which remain stand fully exposed to the
view of the curious traveller.</p>

<p>The Roman Triumphal Arches were one of the characteristic
outgrowths of the Imperial period. These splendid
works were designed to perpetuate the fame of the
emperors and to recall to the people the important acts of
their lives. The arch of Constantine given below is one of
the most famous arches in Rome (<a href="#illus065">Fig.&nbsp;65</a>). It is believed
that parts of it were in an arch of Trajan's time, and some
even go so far as to say that it was originally dedicated to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
the earlier emperor and adopted by Constantine as his own.
It is remarkably well preserved, and this is undoubtedly due
to the fact of its being dedicated to the first Christian sovereign
of Rome. The other most famous arches in the city
are that of Titus, which dates from <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 81, and that of
Septimius Severus, which was erected in honor of him and
of his wife, Julia, by the silversmiths and merchants of the
Forum Boarium, in which spot the arch was raised.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 345px;"><img id="illus065" src="images/illus065.jpg" width="345" height="292" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 65.</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Arch of Constantine.</span> <i>Rome.</i></div></div>

<p>These triumphal arches existed in all the countries
where Rome held sway, and, indeed, this is true of all
kinds of Roman architectural works.</p>

<p>This Arch of Beneventum was erected in the second
century after Christ, by Trajan, when he repaired the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
Appian Way. It is one of the most graceful and best preserved
of all the arches of Italy (<a href="#illus066">Fig.&nbsp;66</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 294px;"><img id="illus066" src="images/illus066.jpg" width="294" height="300" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 66.&mdash;Arch of Trajan.</span> <i>Beneventum.</i></div></div>

<p>All these arches had originally groups of statuary upon
them, for which they served merely as the pedestals. Their
taking the form of an arch was due to their being placed in
the public way, where it was necessary to leave a passage
for the street. Sometimes they were placed where two
roads met, and a double arch was then made. Elaborate
as the arches often were, you must keep in mind that they
are only a part of the entire design, and that the least
important part; the statuary, which has been destroyed by
time, being really the more striking feature of the whole.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 187px;"><img id="illus067" src="images/illus067.jpg" width="187" height="210" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 67.&mdash;Tomb of Cecilia Metella.</span></div></div>

<p>The tombs of Rome were very numerous, and were an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
important element in Roman architecture. The tomb of
Cecilia Metella is of importance because it is the oldest
remaining building of Imperial
Rome and the finest
tomb which has been preserved
(<a href="#illus067">Fig.&nbsp;67</a>).</p>

<p>As you see, the tomb is
a round tower. In the
thirteenth century it was
turned into a fortress, and
so much dust has been deposited
on its summit in
the passing of time that
bushes and ivy now grow
there. Many writers describe
it, and Byron in his
"Childe Harold" spoke
of it in some verses, of
which the following is the beginning:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"There is a stern round tower of other days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Firm as a fortress, with its fence of stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such as an army's baffled strength delays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Standing with half its battlements alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with two thousand years of ivy grown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The garland of eternity, where wave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The green leaves over all by time o'erthrown;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What was this tower of strength? within its cave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What treasure lay so lock'd, so hid?&mdash;a woman's grave."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The tomb of Hadrian, now known as the Castle of St.
Angelo, is very interesting, and is one of the most prominent
and familiar objects in Rome at the present day. But
the tombs called Columbaria were much in use in ancient
Rome, and differed essentially from those of which we have
spoken, inasmuch as they were usually below the ground,
and externally had no architecture. They consisted of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
oblong or square apartments, the sides of which were filled
with small apertures of the proper size to hold an urn which
contained the ashes that remained after a body had been
burned, according to the Roman custom. Some of these
apartments, especially when they belonged to private
families, were adorned with pilasters and decorated with
colors. (See <a href="#illus068">Fig.&nbsp;68</a>.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 289px;"><img id="illus068" src="images/illus068.jpg" width="289" height="184" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 68.</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Columbarium near the Gate of St. Sebastian.</span> <i>Rome.</i></div></div>

<p>The sepulchres of Rome were gradually enlarged, until,
in the days of Constantine, they were frequently built like
small temples above the ground, with crypts or vaults
beneath them.</p>

<p>So little now remains of the ancient domestic architecture
of Rome that one is forced to study this subject from
written descriptions collected from the works of various
historians, poets, and other writers. But from what we
know we may conclude that the villas and country-houses
were so constructed as to be full of comfort, and suited to
the uses for which they were built, without too much regard
to the symmetry of the exteriors. The interior convenience
was the chief thing to be considered, and when finished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
they must have often resembled a collection of buildings all
joined together, of various heights and shapes; but within
they were adapted to the different seasons, as some rooms
were made for being warm, while others were arranged for
coolness; the views from the windows were also an important
feature, and, in short, the pleasure of the people living
in them was made the first point to be gained, rather than
the impression upon the eye of those who saw them from
without.</p>

<p>There was great luxury and elegance in the palaces of
the noble classes in ancient Rome. The home of Diocletian
at Spalatro was one of the most famous Roman
palaces, and its ruins show that it was once magnificent.
This palace was divided by four streets which ran through
it at right angles with each other and met in its centre. Its
entrances were called the Golden, Iron, and Brazen Gates.
Its exterior architecture was simple and massive, as it was
necessary that it should serve as a fortress in case of an
attack. Its principal gallery overlooked the sea; it was five
hundred and fifteen feet long and twenty-four feet wide,
and was famous for its architectural beauty and for the
views which it commanded.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="dropcap">I</span> <span class="dropleftmin">HAVE</span> written more in detail concerning Ancient architecture
than I shall do of that of later times, because it
is best to be thorough in studying the beginnings of things;
then we can make an application of our knowledge which
helps us to understand the results of what has gone before,
just as we are prepared for the full-blown rose after we have

account of Christian architecture, but I shall endeavor
to give such an outline of its rise and progress in
various countries as will make a good foundation for the
knowledge you will gain from books which you will read in
future.</p>

<p>The architecture of Italy in the period which followed
the conversion of the Emperor Constantine is called the
Romanesque order. As the Christians were encouraged
under Constantine and became bold in their worship, many
basilicas were given up for their use. The bishops held the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
principal place upon the platform formerly occupied by the
king and his highest officers, and the priests of the lower
orders were ranged around them. The same altars which
had served for the heathen sacrifices were used for the worship
of the true God, and from this cause the word basilica
has come to signify a large, grand church, in the speech of
our time.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 376px;"><img id="illus069" src="images/illus069.jpg" width="376" height="292" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 69.&mdash;Interior of Basilica of St. Paul's.</span> <i>Rome.</i></div></div>

<p>Among the early basilicas of Rome which still remain
none are more distinguished than that of <i>San Paolo fuori
della Mura</i>, or St. Paul's without the Walls. It was ancient,
and splendid in design and ornament. In 1823 it was
burned, and has been rebuilt with great magnificence, but
the picture above shows it as it was before the fire (<a href="#illus069">Fig.&nbsp;69</a>).
It was built about 386 <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> under the Emperors Valentinian
II. and Theodosius.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
This basilica had four rows of Corinthian columns,
twenty in each row; many of these pillars were taken from
more ancient edifices, and were composed of very beautiful
marbles, forming by far the finest collection of columns in
the world. The bronze gates were cast at Constantinople;
the fine paintings and magnificent mosaics with which it
was decorated added much to its splendor. Tradition
taught that the body of St. Paul was buried beneath the
high altar.</p>

<p>Before the Reformation the sovereigns of England were
protectors of this basilica just as those of France were of
St. John Lateran; this gives it a peculiar interest for
British people, and the symbol of the Order of the Garter
is still seen among its decorations. On account of its associations,
San Paolo was the most interesting, if not the most
beautiful, of the oldest Christian edifices in Rome.</p>

<p>In the early days there were many circular churches
throughout Italy; some of these had been built at first for
tombs. The Christians used churches of this form for
baptisms, for the sacrament for the dying, burials, and
sometimes for marriage.</p>

<p>The circular temple of Vesta is very beautiful. It had
originally twenty Corinthian columns; nineteen of which
still remain. This temple is not older than the time of
Vespasian, and is not the famous one mentioned by Horace
and other ancient writers, in which the Palladium was preserved&mdash;that
temple no longer exists. It is probable that
many of the earliest churches built by Christians in Italy
were circular in form, and numbers of these still remain in
various Italian cities; but they differed from the ancient
temples of this form in their want of exterior decoration.
The ancient Romans had used columns, peristyles, and
porticoes; the Christians used the latter only in a few instances,
but even these were soon abandoned.</p>

<p>The beautiful Baptistery at Florence was originally the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
cathedral of the city. It is octagonal, or eight-sided, and
this form is not infrequent in buildings of the fourth and
following centuries. It is said that this Baptistery was built
by Theodolinda, who married Autharis, King of the Lombards
in 589.</p>

<p>This king had proposed to Garibald, King of Bavaria,
for the hand of his daughter, and had been accepted.
Autharis grew impatient at the ceremonies of the wooing,
and escaping from his palace joined the embassy to the
King of Bavaria.</p>

<p>When they reached the court of Garibald and were received
by that monarch, Autharis advanced to the throne
and told the old king that the ambassador before him was
indeed the Minister of State at the Lombard Court, but
that he was the only real friend of Autharis, and to him
had been given a charge to report to the Italian king concerning
the charms of Theodolinda. Garibald summoned
his daughter, and after an admiring gaze the stranger hailed
her Queen of Italy and respectfully asked that she should,
according to custom, give a glass of wine to the first of her
future subjects who had tendered her his duty. Her father
commanded her to give the cup, and as Autharis returned
it to her he secretly touched her hand and then put his
finger on his own lips. At evening Theodolinda told this
incident to her nurse, who assured her that this handsome
and bold stranger could have been none other than her
future husband, since no subject would venture on such
conduct.</p>

<p>The ambassadors were dismissed, and some Bavarians
accompanied the Lombards to the Italian frontier. Before
they separated Autharis raised himself in his stirrups and
threw his battle-axe against a tree with great skill, exclaiming,
"Such are the strokes of the King of the Lombards!"
Then all knew the rank of this gallant stranger. The
approach of a French army compelled Garibald to leave his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
capital; he took refuge in Italy, and Autharis celebrated
his marriage in the palace of Verona; he lived but one year,
but in that time Theodolinda had so endeared herself to the
people that she was allowed to bestow the Italian sceptre
with her hand. She had converted her husband to the
Catholic faith. She also founded the cathedral of Monza
and other churches in Lombardy and Tuscany, all of which
she dedicated to St. John the Baptist, who was her patron
saint.</p>

<p>The cathedral of Monza is very interesting from its historical
associations. Here is deposited the famous iron
crown which was presented to Theodolinda by Pope
Gregory I. This crown is made of a broad band of gold
set with jewels, and the iron from which it is named is a
narrow circlet inside, said to have been made from one of
the nails used in the crucifixion of Christ, and brought from
Jerusalem by the Empress Helena. This crown is kept in
a casket which forms the centre of the cross above the high
altar in the cathedral of Monza; it was carried away in
1859 by the Austrians; at the close of the Italo-Prussian
war, in 1866, the Emperor of Austria gave it to Victor
Emmanuel, then King of Italy. This crown has been used
at the coronation of thirty-four sovereigns; among them
were Charlemagne, Charles V., and Napoleon I. The
latter wore it at his second coronation as King of the Lombards
in 1805. He placed it on his head himself, saying,
"God has given it to me, woe to him who touches it!"</p>

<p>There are few secular buildings of this period remaining
in Italy, and Romanesque architecture endured but a short
time, for it was almost abandoned at the time of the death
of Gregory the Great, in 604. During the next four and a
half centuries the old styles were dying out and the Gothic
order was developing, but cannot be said to have reached
any high degree of perfection before the close of the
eleventh century.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span></p>

<h3>GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE.</h3>

<p>It is difficult to speak concisely of Gothic architecture
because there is so much that can be said of its origin, and
then it has so extended itself to all parts of the world as to
render it in a sense universal. Perhaps Fergusson makes it
as simple as it can be made when he divides Europe by a
line from Memel on the shores of the Baltic Sea to Spalatro
on the Adriatic, and then carries the line westward to
Fermo and divides Italy almost as the forty-third parallel
of latitude divides it. He then says that during the Middle
Ages, or from about the seventh to the fifteenth centuries,
the architecture north and west of these lines was Gothic;
south and east it was Byzantine, with the exception of
Rome, which always remained individual, and a rule unto
herself.</p>

<p>There was a very general belief in all Christian lands
that the world would end in the year 1000 <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span>, and when
this dreaded period had passed without that event happening,
men seem everywhere to have been seized with a passion
for erecting stone buildings. An old chronicler named
Rodulphe Glaber, who died in 1045 <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span>, relates that as
early as the year 1003 <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> so many churches and monasteries
of marble were being erected, especially in France
and Italy, "that the world appeared to be putting off its
old dingy attire and putting on a new white robe. Then
nearly all the bishops' seats, the churches, the monasteries,
and even the oratories of the villages were changed for
better ones."</p>

<p>Such a movement could not fail to have a great influence
upon architecture, and it was at this time that the Gothic
style began to be rapidly developed; and, indeed, so far as
any particular time may be fixed for the beginning of the
Gothic order, it would fall in the tenth and eleventh centuries.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
The classic forms, with their horizontal cornices
and severe regularity, were then laid aside, and a greater
freedom and variety than had ever obtained before began
to make itself felt in all architectural designs.</p>

<p>We must first try to understand what are the distinguishing
features of Gothic architecture. Perhaps the principal
one may be called constructiveness; which is to say, that
in Gothic architecture there is far greater variety of form,
and the power to make larger and more complicated buildings
than had been possible with the orders which preceded
it. During the Middle Ages the aim was to produce large
edifices, and to build and ornament them in a way that
would make them appear to be even larger than they were.
The early Gothic buildings are so massive as to have a
clumsy effect, because the architects had not yet learned
how to make these enormous masses strong and enduring,
and yet so arranged as to be light and graceful in their
appearance.</p>

<p>A second striking difference between the ancient orders
and the Gothic, is that in the former enormous blocks of
stone or marble were used and great importance was
attached to this. Many ancient works are called Cyclopean
for this reason. It does not make a building more beautiful
to have it massive, but it does make it grand. Even in
a less colossal mode of building a column is more effective
when it is a monolith, and an architrave more beautiful
when its beams are not joined too frequently. But in the
Gothic order the use of massive blocks is largely given up,
and the endeavor is to so arrange smaller materials as to
display remarkable constructive skill.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 405px;"><img id="illus071" src="images/illus071.jpg" width="405" height="393" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 71.&mdash;Church of St. Nicholas.</span> <i>Caen.</i></div></div>

<p>A third and a very important feature of the Gothic
order is the use of the arch. The much-increased constructive
power of which we have spoken depended very largely
upon this. The ancients knew the use of the arch, but did
not like it because they thought that it took away from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
repose of a building. Even now the Hindoos will not use
it; they say, "An arch never sleeps," and though the
Mohammedan builders have used it in their country, the
Hindoos cannot overcome their dislike of it. In the Gothic
order, however, the use of arches, both round and pointed,
is unending. The results are very much varied, and range
all the way from a grand and impressive effect to a sort of
toy-like lightness which seems more suited to the block-houses
made by children than to the works of architects.
The earlier Gothic arches were round, although pointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
arches are occasionally found in very ancient buildings.
The picture (<a href="#illus071">Fig.&nbsp;71</a>), however, gives a just idea of the
form of arch most used until the introduction of the
pointed arch, which occurred in France during the twelfth
century. Of this form the doorways of the next cut present
a fine example (<a href="#illus072">Fig.&nbsp;72</a>).</p>

<p>An important characteristic of Gothic architecture was
the fact that every part of the building was so made as to
show its use. Instead of hiding the supports they were
made prominent. If a pier or buttress was to stand a perpendicular
strain, even the lines of decoration were generally
made to run in that direction; if extra supports were
needed, they were not concealed, but
built in so as to show, and even to be
prominent. In the details the same
feeling was often shown in a very marked
degree; the hinges and nails and locks
of Gothic buildings were made to be
seen, and whatever was needed for use
was treated as if it were of value as an
ornament. The spouts by which the
water was carried over the eaves were made bold and comparatively
large, and carved into those curious shapes of
animals and monsters called gargoyles, which are seen on so
many mediæval edifices. Many of these details of Gothic
buildings are very elegant, and serve to-day as models for
modern workmen. (See Figs. <a href="#illus073">73</a>, <a href="#illus074">74</a>,
<a href="#illus075">75</a>, <a href="#illus076">76</a>, <a href="#illus077">77</a>,
<a href="#illus078">78</a>, <a href="#illus079">79</a>.)</p>

<p>Among the inventions of Gothic architects the division
of the interior into three aisles,
with the centre one much the
highest, was very important.
By this arrangement the space
was made to appear longer and
higher than it really was, and
what was lost in the effect of
width was more than made up in a certain elegance of form
which is very pleasing. The three central aisles of the next
cut illustrate this arrangement (<a href="#illus080">Fig.&nbsp;80</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 411px;"><img id="illus080" src="images/illus080.jpg" width="411" height="245" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 80.&mdash;Section of Church.</span> <i>Carcassone.</i> <span class="smcap">With Outer Aisles added in Fourteenth Century.</span></div></div>

<p>The Gothic builders gave loftiness to their edifices by
the use of spires and towers. They became very skilful in
constructing them with buttresses below and pinnacles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
above, so that the spires should not detract from the apparent
size of the buildings to which they were attached
(<a href="#illus081">Fig.&nbsp;81</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 292px;"><img id="illus081" src="images/illus081.jpg" width="292" height="272" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 81.&mdash;Spires of Laon Cathedral.</span></div></div>

<p>In the matter of design in ornament the Gothic order
had no fixed method, except so far as its forms were symbolic.
Every form of vegetable design was employed; vines
and leaves were abundant. As a rule the use of human
forms or animals as supports to columns or other weights
was avoided. If they were introduced the animals were
not reproductions of such as exist, but the imaginary griffin
or other monster, and at times dwarfs or grotesque human
beings, were represented as if for caricatures.</p>

<p>Sculptured figures were usually placed upon a pedestal
either with or without niches for them, and were not made
to appear to be a part of the building itself. The deep
recesses of Gothic portals, the pinnacles and niches gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
opportunities to display exterior sculpture to great advantage
(<a href="#illus082">Fig.&nbsp;82</a>). The interiors were also appropriate for any
amount of artistic ornament in bas-reliefs or figures that
could be lavished upon them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 292px;"><img id="illus082" src="images/illus082.jpg" width="292" height="374" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 82.&mdash;Portal of the Minorites' Church.</span> <i>Vienna.</i></div></div>

<p>The most original and effective feature of ornament,
however, which was introduced by Gothic architects is that
of painted glass. To this they devoted their best talent.
It is not necessary to say how beautiful and decorative it
is; we all know this, and our only wonder is that it was left
for the Gothic architects to apply it to architectural uses.
We do not know precisely when stained or painted glass
was invented, but we know that it existed as early as 800,
and came into very general use in the eleventh and twelfth
centuries.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 128px;"><img id="illus083" src="images/illus083.jpg" width="128" height="248" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 83&mdash;External Elevation, Cathedral of Paris.</span></div></div>

<p>Before painted glass was used windows were made very
small, and it was some time before the large, rich style was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
adopted. The following cut from Notre Dame, at Paris,
gives the three stages of the change, and it is interesting to
see them thus in one church (<a href="#illus083">Fig.&nbsp;83</a>).</p>

<p>On the left are the undivided windows without mullions
or dividing supports; next, at the right, the upper window
shows the form with one perpendicular mullion and a circular
or rose window above the centre; lastly, on the right
of the lower story we see a full traceried window.</p>

<p>The window became one of the most important and
characteristic features of Gothic buildings. These large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
open spaces gave opportunity for elegant shapes and splendid
colors, both the form of the opening and the dividing
ribs, or tracery, as it was called, being made with the utmost
beauty and grace. The round
windows, called rose windows and
wheel windows, were often exquisitely
designed, as the following
example shows (<a href="#illus084">Fig.&nbsp;84</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 280px;"><img id="illus084" src="images/illus084.jpg" width="280" height="277" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 84.&mdash;Wheel Window, from Cathedral.</span> <i>Toscanella.</i></div></div>

<p>The window is illustrative of the
influence which climate may have
on the development of architectural
style. In warm countries where
spaces were left open, window forms
and painted glass were, of course,
never employed; but in more northern
lands they became one of the
most marked features in important
edifices.</p>

<p>A whole book might be written
about these windows and be very
interesting also, but we can give no
more space to them here.</p>

<p>Gothic architecture gradually extended from the centre
of Italy to the most northern bounds of civilization, and
though practised by so many nations, was as much the
architectural expression of a religion as the architecture of
a single ancient nation had been the outgrowth of its
peculiar religious belief. During the Middle Ages the
priests and monks preserved learning in the midst of general
darkness and ignorance, and were the chief patrons of
all art which survived the decline of the time. They built
up the Christian faith by every means in their power. The
monks were missionaries. They went to various countries,
and selecting favorable spots they founded abbeys; around
these abbeys a poor population settled; gradually churches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
were built, and it frequently happened that the monks not
only planned the work to be done, but also executed it
with their own hands. Many of them were masons and
builders, and several bishops were architects. St. Germain,
Bishop of Paris, designed the church in that city now
called by his name, and was also sent to Angers to build
another church, and to Mans to erect a monastery.</p>

<p>The finest buildings being thus made for religious purposes
and under the direction of the clergy, they must have
been as full an expression of Christianity as were the temple-palaces
of Egypt an expression of the religion of Osiris and
Isis, when the kings were both priests and sovereigns, and
dwelt in these palaces. And this was true as long as
Gothic art was in the hands of the clergy and used almost
entirely for religious purposes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
Later on, when it was employed for civic edifices erected
under the direction of laymen, it became an expression of
political independence also. The freedom of thought which
came with the decline of the feudal system inspired new
aspirations and imaginations in the hearts and minds of
men, and these found expression in all the arts, and very
especially in architecture. If we cannot always admire the
manner in which Gothic art was made to express these lofty
desires, we can fully sympathize with the sentiment which
was behind it.</p>

<p>The Gothic order held undisputed sway west and north
of the geographical line of which we have spoken until the
fifteenth century. Then a revival of classical literature
took place, and with this there arose also a revival of
classic art and architecture; this revival is known as the
Renaissance, or the new birth, and the period of time is
spoken of as that of the Renaissance. The effect of this
classic reaction was very great upon all the educated classes
of Europe, and its influence may be said to have endured
through about three centuries.</p>

<p>Again, during the eighteenth century, Gothic art was
revived. A reverence has grown up for the good that
wrestled with the darkness of the Middle Ages and survived
all their evils. The rough, strong manhood of that time is
now justly appreciated. Perhaps the feeling in this direction
is too much exaggerated. While our regard for a rude
and weather-stained monument of the spirit and architecture
of the past may be natural and proper, the imitation
of it which is made in our day may easily become absurd,
and is very rarely suited to our purposes.</p>

<p>Spain is one of the countries which are on the Gothic
side of the geographical line we have drawn, and among the
many splendid edifices in that country some of the finest
are of the Gothic order. There is no national architecture
there, for though the Spaniards love art and its expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
passionately, they have themselves invented almost nothing
which is artistic.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 317px;"><img id="illus085" src="images/illus085.jpg" width="317" height="301" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 85.&mdash;Collegiate Church, Toro.</span> <i>From Villa Amil.</i></div></div>

<p>But while it is true that the Spaniards invented no
styles, they did modify those which they adopted, and
there are peculiarities in the Spanish use and arrangement
of the Gothic order which give it new elements in the eyes
of those who understand architecture scientifically. To the
uneducated also it appears to have a personality of its own,
something that is suited to Spain and the Spaniards; so
that, while we know that Spanish Gothic architecture was
borrowed from France and Germany, we yet feel that if the
cathedrals of Paris and Cologne were to be put down in
Valencia or Madrid they would look like strangers, and not
at all well-contented ones at that; and if the churches of
Toledo or Burgos were copied precisely in any other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
country, they would have an air of being quite out of keeping
with everything around them (<a href="#illus085">Fig.&nbsp;85</a>).</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 202px;"><img id="illus086" src="images/illus086.jpg" width="202" height="362" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 86.&mdash;St. Paul.</span> <i>Saragossa.</i></div></div>

<p>We call the architecture of Spain before 1066 the
"Early Spanish," and from that time the Gothic order prevailed
during nearly three centuries.</p>

<p>Meantime in the south
of Spain the Moresco or
Moorish order had sprung
up, of which <a href="#illus086">Fig.&nbsp;86</a>
gives an example. It
was gradually adopted to
a limited extent, until
finally some specimens of
it existed in almost every
province of the country.
The Gothic order was affected
by it, inasmuch as
the richness of ornament
of the Moorish order so
pleased the taste of the
Spaniards that their architects
allowed themselves
to indulge in a certain
Moorish manner of treating
the Gothic style. We
cannot describe these
differences in words, but
Figs. <a href="#illus086">86</a> and <a href="#illus087">87</a> will make
it plain.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 208px;"><img id="illus087" src="images/illus087.jpg" width="208" height="329" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 87.&mdash;Cloister.</span> <i>Tarazona.</i></div></div>

<p>As has been said, the interior decoration of all Gothic
churches was very rich and abundant. It is also true that
all church furniture was made with great care; the matter
of symbolism was carefully considered, and each design
made to indicate the use of the article for which it was intended.
No altar, preaching-desk, stall, chair, or screen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
was made without due attention to every detail, and the
endeavor to have it in harmony with its use and its position
in the church. The following cut shows a rood-screen,
which was the kind of screen that was placed before the
crucifixion over the high altar (<a href="#illus088">Fig.&nbsp;88</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 379px;"><img id="illus088" src="images/illus088.jpg" width="379" height="425" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 88.&mdash;Rood-Screen, from the Madeleine.</span> <i>Troyes.</i></div></div>

<p>The fantastic sculptures and wealth of ornament in
Gothic decorations produce
a confusing effect
on the brain and the
eye if we look at the
whole carelessly; but
when we remember that
each separate design has
its especial meaning we
are interested to examine
them, and we find
that the variety of forms
is almost innumerable.
Where there are trailing
vines and lions, faith is
indicated; roses and
pelicans are the symbols
of mercy and divine
love; dogs and ivy, of
truth; lambs, of gentleness,
innocence, and submission;
fishes are an
emblem of water and
the rite of baptism; the
dragon, of sin and paganism; a serpent, too, typifies sin,
and when wound around a globe it indicates the power
of evil over the whole world; a hind or hart signifies
solitude; the dove, purity; the olive, peace; the palm,
martyrdom; the lily, purity and chastity; the lamp,
lantern, or taper, piety; fire and flames, zeal and the sufferings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
of martyrdom; a flaming heart, fervent piety and
spiritual love; a shell, pilgrimage; a standard or banner,
victory; and so on, and on, we find that meaning and
thought were worked out in every bit of Gothic ornament,
and that what at first appears so wild and hap-hazard is full
of a method which well repays one for the study of it.</p>

<p>The Gothic order was also used in building municipal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
edifices, palaces, and even for the purposes of domestic
architecture. The finest remains of this kind are in Germany,
the most interesting of them all being the castle on
the Wartburg. This castle is large, grand, and imposing.
It is also well preserved. A few years ago it was discovered
that many windows and arched galleries, of very beautiful
style, had been filled up, and that frescoes and other decorations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
had been covered. The Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar
caused its restoration, and the ancient halls are now quite
in their original state. (See <a href="#illus089">Fig.&nbsp;89</a>.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 287px;"><img id="illus089" src="images/illus089.jpg" width="287" height="432" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 89.&mdash;Palace of Wartburg.</span></div></div>

<p>There are very interesting legends and historical facts
connected with this castle of Wartburg. As early as 1204
to 1208, when Hermann, Count of Thuringia, dwelt there
with his wife, the Countess Sophia, it is related that the
"War of the Minstrels" occurred. This was a contest
between several of the wandering minstrels or Minnesingers
of that time as to who should excel, and he who failed was
to suffer death. The penalty fell on Henry of Ofterdingen;
in his despair he begged the Countess to gain him
a respite so that he could go for his master, Klingsor. Her
prayer was granted, and in the end Henry of Ofterdingen
saved his head, though the legend says that Satan aided
him. This story is without doubt founded on truth, but has
much of fancy mingled with it.</p>

<p>The next remarkable story connected with Wartburg is
the residence here of St. Elizabeth of Hungary, as she is
called. This wonderful woman was the daughter of the
King of Hungary, and when four years old she was betrothed
to Prince Louis, son of Count Hermann, mentioned
above. At this tender age she was given to his family.
Her life at Wartburg was very remarkable, and I advise
you to read about it, for it is too long to be given here. At
last, her husband having died in Jerusalem, where he had
gone with the Crusaders, his brother Henry drove her out
with her children to seek a home where she could. She
suffered much, and supported herself by spinning wool.
But when the knights who had gone with her husband returned,
they obliged Henry to give the son of Elizabeth his
rights. She received the city of Marburg as her dower, but
she did not live long. Miraculous things are told of her,
and she is often represented by painters and sculptors.</p>

<p>Again, Wartburg was the residence of a remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
person; for Luther dwelt there after escaping from the Diet
at Worms. He was called Ritter George, and the room
where he wrote and spent
much of his time is shown
to travellers who visit the
castle.</p>

<p>We come back now to
Italy, the country we left
when we passed from the
Romanesque to Gothic
architecture. In the north
of Italy where the Gothic
order had prevailed after
the eleventh century, it
had been modified by the
Romanesque influences and
Roman traditions, in some
such degree as the Moors
had influenced the Gothic
order in Spain. But, on the
whole, the mediæval buildings
of Northern Italy
were Gothic in style.</p>

<p>Rome, as we said, was
individual, and her art remained
Roman or Romanesque
up to the date of the
Renaissance. In Southern
Italy, as we shall see, the
architecture was of the Byzantine
order.</p>

<p>Among the most interesting
edifices of the Middle
Ages are the Italian towers.
They were frequently quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
separate from the churches and were built for various purposes.
Some of them were bell towers, and such a tower
was called a <i>campanile</i>. Others were in some way associated
with the civic power of the cities which built them; but the
largest number were for religious uses.</p>

<p>The <i>campanile</i> is always square at the bottom and for
some distance up, and then is frequently changed to an
octagonal or circular form and finished with a slender spire
or ornamental design.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 189px;"><img id="illus090" src="images/illus090.jpg" width="189" height="519" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 90.</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Tower of Cremona.</span></div></div>

<p><a href="#illus090">Fig.&nbsp;90</a> shows one of the finest square towers in
all Italy. It was built in 1296 to commemorate a peace
after a long war. It is three hundred and ninety-six feet
high. It has little beauty in the lower two thirds; above
that it is more pleasing, but the two parts do not look as if
they belonged together. The tower of Italy, however,
which is most beloved and most famous is that of Giotto,
beside the cathedral of Florence. (See <a href="#illus102">Fig.&nbsp;102</a>.)</p>

<p>Another striking feature of Gothic art in Northern Italy
is seen in the porches attached to the churches. They are
commonly on the side, and as they were usually added after
the rest of the church was finished, and frequently do not
correspond to the rest in style, they look as if they were
parts of some other churches and had come on a visit to
those beside which they stand. In Italy the main portion
of these porches always rested on lions.</p>

<p>A porch at Bergamo is one of the finest, and certainly
its details are exquisite, and the whole structure is beautiful
when it is considered separately; but as a part of the church
it loses its effect, and seems to be pushed against it as a
chair is placed beside the wall of a room.</p>

<p>Some of the mediæval town-halls are still well preserved,
and a few of them are truly beautiful. Perhaps the Broletto
at Como is as fine a remnant of civic architecture as exists
in Northern Italy. It is not very large and is faced with
party-colored marbles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
The architecture of Venice and the Venetian Province
must be treated almost as if it were outside of Italy, because
it differs so much from that of other portions of that
country. During the Middle Ages it was the most prosperous
portion of Italy. Its architecture was influenced by
the Byzantine and Saracenic orders, but is not like them;
neither is it like that of Northern Italy; in fact, it is Venetian,
being Gothic in principle, but treated with Eastern
feeling and decorated in Oriental taste; and this was quite
natural since the Venetians had extensive traffic and intercourse
with the nations of the East.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 546px;"><img id="illus091" src="images/illus091.jpg" width="546" height="398" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 91.</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">St. Mark's Cathedral.</span> <i>Venice.</i></div></div>

<p>There are few places in the world, of no greater extent,
about which so many interesting associations cluster as
about the Piazza of St. Mark's in Venice. On one side
stands the great basilica, and not far away are the <i>campanile</i>
and the clock-tower; the ancient Doge's Palace, and
the beautiful Library of St. Mark, of later date, are near by,
with their treasures of art and literature to increase the
value of the whole. It is a spot dear to all, and especially
so to English-speaking people, since the poetry of Shakespeare
has given them a reason for personal interest in it
under all its varying aspects. At some hours of the day
St. Mark's seems as if it were the very centre of the earth,
to which men of all nations are hastening; again this bustle
dies away, and one could fancy it to be forgotten and deserted
of all mankind, though its silence is eloquent in its
power to recall the great events of the Venice of the past.
(See Figs. <a href="#illus091">91</a>, <a href="#illus105">105</a>, and <a href="#illus106">106</a>.)</p>

<p>St. Mark's Basilica is called Byzantine in its order, and
in a general way the term is applicable to it; but on careful
examination there are so many differences between it
and a purely Byzantine church that it would be more properly
described by the name Italian or Venetian Byzantine.
Its five domes were added to its original form late in the
Middle Ages, and though there are many Eastern mosques<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
with this number, they are not arranged like those of St.
Mark's, and so have quite a different appearance. The
portico with its five entrances is not European in form, but
the details of these deep recesses are more like the Norman
architecture than like anything Byzantine.</p>

<p>It is scarcely profitable to carry this examination farther,
for, in a word, the whole effect of St. Mark's is very impressive
from the exterior, and the interior is so beautiful in its
subdued light and shadow that one is satisfied to enjoy it
without criticising it, and many critics consider it one of the
finest interiors of Western Europe.</p>

<p>The same difficulty which one finds in defining or classing
the architecture of Venice is met in that of Southern
Italy, which is Byzantine and not Byzantine, but, in fact,
is that order so changed that the name of Byzantine-Romanesque
seems better suited to it than any other term
could be. We shall mention but a single example of this
order, and pass to the true Byzantine style.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 393px;"><img id="illus092" src="images/illus092.jpg" width="393" height="174" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 92.&mdash;Section of San Miniato.</span> <i>Near Florence.</i></div></div>

<p>The church of San Miniato, which overlooks the city of
Florence, was built in 1013, and is one of the most perfect
as well as one of the earliest of the churches of the Byzantine-Romanesque
order in Italy. It is not large, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
proportions are so good as to make it very pleasing; the
pillars are so nearly classic in design that they were probably
taken from some earlier building, and the effect of
colored panelling both within and without is very satisfactory
to the eye. (See <a href="#illus092">Fig.&nbsp;92</a>.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 356px;"><img id="illus093" src="images/illus093.jpg" width="356" height="353" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 93.</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">San Giovanni degli Eremiti.</span> <i>Palermo.</i></div></div>

<p>There arose in Sicily in the eleventh century, and after
the Norman Conquest, a remarkable style of architecture.
It belongs to Christian art because it was used by Christians
to construct places of Christian worship; but, in truth, it
was a combination of Greek spirit with Roman form and
Saracenic ornament. It makes an interesting episode in the
study of architecture. I shall give one picture of a church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
built by King Roger for Christian use as late as 1132, which,
except for the tower, might well be mistaken for a purely
Oriental edifice (<a href="#illus093">Fig.&nbsp;93</a>).</p>

<h3>BYZANTINE ARCHITECTURE.</h3>

<p>This term strictly belongs to the order which arose in
the East after Constantinople was made the Roman capital.
It is especially the order of the Greek Church as contrasted
with the Latin or Roman Church. It would make all architectural
writing and talking much clearer if this fact were
kept in mind; but, unfortunately, wherever some special bit
of carving in an Oriental design or a little colored decoration
is used&mdash;as is frequently done in the modern composite
styles of building&mdash;the term Byzantine is carelessly applied,
until it is difficult for one not learned in architecture to discover
what the Byzantine order is, or where it belongs.</p>

<p>We have spoken of its influence and partial use in Italy.
Now we will consider it in its home and its purity. Before
the time of Constantine the architecture used at Rome was
employed at Jerusalem, Constantinople, and other Eastern
cities which were under Roman rule and influence. Between
the time of Constantine and the death of Justinian,
in <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 565, the true ancient Byzantine order was developed.
The church of St. Sophia, at Constantinople, was the
greatest and the last product of the pure old Byzantine
style.</p>

<p>From that time the order employed may be called the
Neo-Byzantine. This was a decline of art as much as the
history of Greece and the Eastern Empire during the same
period (about 600 to 1453) was the history of the decline
and extinction of a power that had once been as great among
governments as St. Sophia (<a href="#illus094">Fig.&nbsp;94</a>) was among churches.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 529px;"><img id="illus094" src="images/illus094.jpg" width="529" height="340" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 94.</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Church of St. Sophia.</span> <i>Constantinople. Exterior View.</i></div></div>

<p>The chief characteristic of Byzantine architecture is the
use of the dome, which is the most important part of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
design. A grand central dome rises over the principal portion
of the edifice, and just as in other orders courts and
colonnades were added to the simpler basilica form in the
ground plan of the
churches, so in the
Byzantine order lesser
domes and cupolas
were added above until
almost any number
of them was admissible,
and they were
placed with little attention
to regularity or
symmetry of arrangement.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 227px;"><img id="illus095" src="images/illus095.jpg" width="227" height="279" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 95.&mdash;Lower Order of St. Sophia.</span></div></div>

<p>As domes were the
chief exterior feature,
so the profuse ornamentation
was most
noticeable in the interior.
The walls were
richly decorated with
variegated marbles;
the vaulted ceilings of the domes and niches were lined
with brilliant mosaics; the columns, friezes, cornices, door
and window-frames, and the railings to galleries were of
marbles, and entirely covered with ornamental designs
(Figs. <a href="#illus095">95</a> and <a href="#illus096">96</a>).</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 169px;"><img id="illus096" src="images/illus096.jpg" width="169" height="195" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 96.&mdash;Upper Order Of St. Sophia.</span></div></div>

<p>The historian Gibbon describes the building of St.
Sophia and its decorations. He tells us that the emperor
went daily, clad in a linen tunic, to oversee the work. The
architect was named Anthemius; he employed ten thousand
workmen, and they were all paid each evening. When it
was completed and Justinian was present at its consecration,
he exclaimed, "Glory be to God, who hath thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
me worthy to accomplish so great a work; I have vanquished
thee, O Solomon!"</p>

<p>Paul Silentiarius was a poet; he saw St. Sophia in all its
glory and describes it with enthusiasm. It was very rich in
variegated marbles. He mentions the following: 1. <i>The
Carystian</i>, pale with iron veins. 2. <i>The Phrygian</i>, two
sorts, both of a rosy hue; one with a white shade, the
other purple with silver flowers. 3. <i>The Porphyry of
Egypt</i>, with small stars. 4. <i>The green marble of Laconia.</i>
5. <i>The Carian</i>, from Mount Iassis, with oblique veins, white
and red. 6. <i>The Lydian</i>, pale,
with a red flower. 7. <i>The
African or Mauritanian</i>, of a
gold or saffron hue. 8. <i>The
Celtic</i>, black, with white veins.
9. <i>The Bosphoric</i>, white, with
black edges. There were also
the <i>Proconnesian</i>, which made
the pavement; and the <i>Thessalian</i>
and <i>Molossian</i> in different
parts.</p>

<p>This array of marbles was
made even more effective by
the beautiful columns brought
from older temples. The mosaics
were rich in color, and numerous, and many parts of
the church were covered with gold, so that the effect was
dazzling.</p>

<p>Those objects that were most sacred were of solid gold
and silver, while such as were less important were only
covered with gold-leaf. In the sanctuary there was altogether
forty thousand pounds of silver; the vases and vessels
used about the altar were of pure gold and studded
with gems. Its whole cost was almost beyond belief. At
the close of his description Gibbon says: "A magnificent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
temple is a laudable monument of taste and religion, and
the enthusiast who entered the dome of St. Sophia might
be tempted to suppose that it was the residence or even the
workmanship of the Deity. Yet how dull is the artifice,
how insignificant is the labor, if it be compared with the
formation of the vilest insect that crawls upon the surface
of the temple!"</p>

<p>Of course, individual taste must largely influence the
opinion regarding the beauty of any work of art, but to me
St. Sophia, which is the chief example of Byzantine architecture,
is far less beautiful and less grand than the finest
Gothic cathedrals. Comparatively little attention was paid
to the elegance and decoration of the exterior in the
Eastern edifices, while the interiors, in spite of all their
riches, have a flat and unrelieved effect. Probably the
chief reason for this is that color is substituted for relief&mdash;that
is to say, in Gothic architecture heavy mouldings and
panellings, though of the same color as the walls themselves,
yet produce a marvellous effect of light and shadow,
and even lend an element of perspective to various parts of
the building. In the place of these mouldings flat bands of
color are often used in the Byzantine order, and the whole
result is much weakened, though a certain gorgeousness
comes from the color. Another cause of disappointment in
St. Sophia is the absence of painted glass. At the same
time, and in spite of these defects, St. Sophia is grand and
beautiful&mdash;but not solemn and impressive in comparison
with the dim cathedral aisles of many Gothic churches in
other parts of the world. (See <a href="#illus097">Fig.&nbsp;97</a>.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 579px;"><img id="illus097" src="images/illus097.jpg" width="579" height="379" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 97.</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Interior View of Church of St. Sophia.</span></div></div>

<p>The Romanesque and Byzantine styles came at last to
be so mingled that it would be folly to attempt to separate
their influence, but the Byzantine had much more originality,
and left a far wider mark.</p>

<p>Among the most noted examples of the latter style,
beside St. Sophia and St. Mark's, are the church of St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
Vitale at Ravenna, the cathedral at Aix-la-Chapelle, supposed
to have been built by Charlemagne about 800 <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span>,
and the church of the Mother of God at Constantinople.</p>

<h3>SARACENIC ARCHITECTURE.</h3>

<p>In speaking of Saracenic architecture I will first explain
that it is one with the Moresco or Moorish order of which
I spoke in connection with Spain. The only difference is
that the earliest Mohammedan conquerors of Spain are said
to have come from ancient Mauri or Mauritania and were
called Moors, while the name of <i>Saraceni</i>, which means
"the Easterns," was also given to them. Thus the
Mohammedan architecture in Spain is called both Moresco,
or Moorish, and Saracenic. Again, it is also called
Arabian, but I think this is the least correct, since the
Easterns who went to Spain were not so universally Arabian
as to warrant this name. When we speak of Moresco or
Moorish architecture we speak of Spain; but the term
Saracenic is used for Mohammedan architecture in all
countries where it is found, and is a just term, for they are
Eastern or Oriental lands.</p>

<p>In absolute fact, Saracenic architecture is that of the
followers of "the Prophet," as Mohammed is called, and
would be more suitably named if it were called Mohammedan
architecture, or the architecture of Islam.</p>

<p>Mohammed was born at Mecca <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 570, but it was not
until 611 that he was commissioned, as he believed, to build
up a new faith and a new church. At first his followers
were so few and so mingled with other sects and tribes in
their outward life that they had no distinctive art. It was
not until <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 876, when the ruler Ibn-Touloun commenced
his splendid mosque at Cairo, that the Mohammedans could
claim any architecture as their own. It is very interesting
to know that there were pointed arches in this mosque,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
probably two centuries, at least, earlier than they were used
in England, for it is generally believed that they were first
used there in the rebuilding of Canterbury Cathedral after
it was burned in 1174. When, however, the Saracenic
order was fully established it was so individual and so different
from all other architecture that there is no mistaking it
for that of any other religion or nation than that of
Mohammed and his followers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
The picture of the mosque of Kaitbey shows one of the
finest and most elegant mosques of the East. It is just
outside the walls of Cairo, and is quite modern, having been
built in 1463. This view of it gives an excellent idea of the
appearance of a fine mosque and shows the minaret or
tower, which is so important in a mosque, to good advantage
(<a href="#illus098">Fig.&nbsp;98</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 295px;"><img id="illus098" src="images/illus098.jpg" width="295" height="423" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 98.</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Mosque of Kaitbey.</span></div></div>

<p>These minarets are constantly used for the many calls
to prayer which are made throughout the day and night.
The person who makes these calls is styled "the Muezzin,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
and is usually blind. Several times during the day he
ascends the minaret and calls out in a loud and melodious
tone, "God is most great; there is no God but Allah, and
I testify that Mohammed is Allah's prophet! Come to
prayer! Come to security! Prayer is better than sleep!"
This is several times repeated and is called the <i>Adan</i>.</p>

<p>The form of words used for the night varies a little,
ending, "There is no God but Allah. He has no companion!
To Him belongs dominion, etc.;" this is called
the <i>Ula</i>. The call made an hour before day is the <i>Ebed</i>,
and praises the perfection of God. When one is sleeping
near enough to a minaret to hear the muezzin's voice it is a
pleasant sound and helps one to realize that the care of
God is ever about him; the clear, Christian bell can be
heard by more people, and this was originally intended as a
call to prayer. (See <a href="#illus099">Fig.&nbsp;99</a>.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 269px;"><img id="illus099" src="images/illus099.jpg" width="269" height="379" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 99.</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Call To Prayer.</span></div></div>

<p>The principal homes of Saracenic architecture are Syria,
Egypt, Mecca, Barbary, Spain, Sicily, Turkey, Persia, and
India. There are many very interesting mosques and
minarets that might be mentioned had we space, but I can
speak only of the mosque of Cordova, which is universally
admitted to be the finest Saracenic edifice in the world
(<a href="#illus100">Fig.&nbsp;100</a>), and shall quote a part of the interesting description
of it given by De Amicis in his delightful book called
"Spain and the Spaniards."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 255px;"><img id="illus100" src="images/illus100.jpg" width="255" height="249" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 100.</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Exterior of the Sanctuary in the Mosque of Cordova.</span></div></div>

<p>This mosque was commenced by the Caliph Abd-er-Rahman
in 786, and was completed by his son Heshâm,
who died 796. The great Caliph declared that he would
build a mosque which should exceed all others in the world
and be the Mecca of the West. De Amicis, after describing
the garden which surrounds the mosque, enters, and
then goes on as follows: "Imagine a forest, fancy yourself
in the thickest portion of it, and that you can see nothing
but the trunks of trees. So, in this mosque, on whatever
side you look, the eye loses itself among the columns. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
is a forest of marble whose confines one cannot discover.
You follow with your eye, one by one, the very long rows
of columns that interlace at every step with numberless
other rows, and you reach a semi-obscure background, in
which other columns still seem to be gleaming. There are
nineteen naves, which extend in every direction, traversed
by thirty-three others, supported (among them all) by more
than nine hundred columns of porphyry, jasper, breccia,
and marbles of every color. Each column upholds a small
pilaster, and between them runs an arch (see plate above),
and a second one extends from pilaster to pilaster, the
latter placed above the former, and both of them in the
shape of a horseshoe; so that, in imagining the columns to
be the trunks of so many trees, the arches represent the
branches, and the similitude of the mosque to a forest is
complete.... How much variety there is in that edifice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
which at first sight seems so uniform! The proportions of
the columns, the designs of the capitals, the forms of the
arches change, one might say, at every step. The majority
of the columns are old, and were taken from the Arabs of
Northern Spain, Gaul, and Roman Africa, and some are
said to have belonged to a temple of Janus, on the ruins of
which was built the church that the Arabs destroyed in
order to erect the mosque. Above several of the capitals
one can still see traces of the crosses that were cut on them,
which the Arabs broke with their chisels.... I stopped
for a long time to look at the ceiling and walls of the principal
chapel, the only part of the mosque that is quite intact.
It is a dazzling gleam of crystals of a thousand colors,
a network of arabesques, which puzzles the mind, and a
complication of bas-reliefs, gildings, ornaments, minutiæ of
design and coloring, of a delicacy, grace, and perfection
sufficient to drive the most patient painter distracted....
You might turn a hundred times to look at it, and it would
only seem to you, in thinking it over, a mingling of blue,
red, green, gilded and luminous points, or a very intricate
embroidery changing continually, with the greatest rapidity,
both design and coloring. Only from the fiery and indefatigable
imagination of the Arabs could such a perfect
miracle of art emanate.... Such is the mosque of to-day.
But what must it have been in the time of the Arabs? It
was not surrounded by a wall, but open, so that one could
catch a glimpse of the garden from every part of it; and
from the garden one could see to the end of the long naves,
and the air was full of the fragrance of oranges and flowers.
The columns which now number less than a thousand were
then fourteen hundred; the ceiling was of cedar-wood and
larch, sculptured and enamelled in the finest manner; the
walls were trimmed with marble; the light of eight hundred
lamps, filled with perfumed oil, made all the crystals in the
mosaics gleam, and produced on the pavements, arches, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
walls a marvellous play of color and reflection. 'A sea of
splendors,' sang a poet, 'filled this mysterious recess; the
ambient air was impregnated with aromas and harmonies,
and the thoughts of the faithful wandered and lost themselves
in the labyrinth of columns which gleamed like lances
in the sun.'"</p>

<p>The famous palace of the Alhambra is so well known
that I cannot leave this part of our subject without one
picture and one bit of description of it from the same
author, De Amicis.</p>

<p>The Alhambra was built about four centuries ago, and
the wall which inclosed it was four thousand feet long by
twenty-two hundred feet wide. Within this there were
gardens, fountains, kiosks, and many beautiful, fanciful
structures, all of which doubtless cost as much as the more
necessary parts of the edifice. The roofs of the different
parts of the palace were supported by forty-three hundred
columns of precious marbles; eleven hundred and seventy-two
of these were presented to Abd-er-Rahman (for he was
also the founder of the Alhambra) by sovereigns of other
countries, or else brought by him from distant shores for
the decoration of this splendid, fairy-like place. All the
pavements were of beautiful marbles; the walls, too, were
of the same material, with friezes arranged in splendid
colors; the ceilings were of deep blue color, with figures in
gilding and interlacing designs running over all. In truth,
nothing that could be imagined or wealth buy to make this
palace beautiful was left out; and yet we are told that the
palace of Zahra which was destroyed was still finer. All
this leads one to almost believe that the "Arabian Nights"
are no fanciful tales, but quite as true as many more serious
sounding stories.</p>

<p>The Court of the Lions is called "the gem of Arabian
art in Spain," and of this our author says: "It is a forest
of columns, a mingling of arches and embroideries, an indefinable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
elegance, an indescribable delicacy, a prodigious
richness, a something light, transparent, and undulating
like a great pavilion of lace; with almost the appearance of
a building which must dissolve at a breath; a variety of
lights, views, mysterious darkness, a confusion, a capricious
disorder of little things, the majesty of a palace, the gayety
of a kiosk, an amorous grace, an extravagance, a delirium,
the fancy of an imaginative child, the dream of an angel, a
madness, a nameless something&mdash;such is the first effect produced
by the Court of the Lions!" (<a href="#illus101">Fig.&nbsp;101</a>.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 479px;"><img id="illus101" src="images/illus101.jpg" width="479" height="384" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 101.</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Court of the Lions. Alhambra.</span></div></div>

<p>This court is not large; the ceiling is high, and a light
portico runs round it upheld by white marble columns in
clusters of two, three, or more, so arranged as to resemble
trees coming up from the ground. Above the columns the
designs almost resemble curtains, and there are little graceful
suggestions like ribbons and waving flowers. "From
the middle of the shortest sides advance two groups of
columns, which form two species of square temples of nine
arches each (see cut) surmounted by as many colored
cupolas. The walls of these little temples and the exterior
of the portico are a real lace-work of stucco, embroideries,
and hems, cut and pierced from one side to the other, and
as transparent as net-work, changing in design at every
step. Sometimes they end in points, in crimps, in festoons,
sometimes in ribbons waving round the arches, in kinds of
stalactites, fringes, trinkets, and bows which seem to move
and mingle with each other at the slightest breath of air.
Large Arabic inscriptions run along the four walls, over the
arches, around the capitals, and on the walls of the little
temples. In the centre of the court rises a great marble
basin, upheld by twelve lions (see cut), and surrounded by
a little paved canal.... At every step one takes in the
court that forest of columns seems to move and change
place, to form again in another way; behind one column,
which seems alone, two, three, or a row will spring out;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
others separate, unite, and separate again.... We remained
for more than an hour in the court, and it passed
like a flash; I, too, did what almost all people do, be they
Spanish or strangers, men or women, poets or not. I ran
my hand along the walls, touched all the little columns,
and passed my two hands around them, one by one, as
around the waist of a child; I hid among them, counted
them, looked at them on a hundred sides, crossed the court
in a hundred ways, tried if it were true that in saying a
word, <i>sotto voce</i>, into the mouth of one lion, one could hear
it distinctly from the mouths of all the others; I looked on
the marbles for the spots of blood of poetic legends, and
wearied both brain and eye over the arabesques.... In
all my life I have never thought, nor said, nor shall I say,
so many foolish, stupid, pretty, senseless things as I said and
thought in that hour."</p>

<p>The study of Saracenic architecture in Turkey, Persia,
and India is very interesting, but our space warns us that
we must hasten to leave this dreamy, fairy-like part of our
subject and come down to later times and more realistic
matters.</p>

<span class="subhead">MODERN ARCHITECTURE.<br />

1400 A.D. TO THE PRESENT TIME.</span></h2>

<p class="in0"><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="dropleftmid">LL</span> Architecture since the time of the Renaissance is
called Modern Architecture; this term, therefore,
embraces all edifices erected during nearly four centuries.</p>

<p>When I first spoke of Architecture I said that it was a
constructive art, and not imitative like Painting and Sculpture.
In its earlier history this was true, but the time came
when it also became an imitative art and had no true or
original style. The Gothic order was the last distinct order
which arose, and since its decline, at the beginning of the
Renaissance, all architecture has been an imitation because
it is a reproduction of what existed before; at times some
one of the older orders has been in favor and closely imitated,
and again, parts of several orders are combined in
one edifice. Since the time of the Reformation it has been
true, almost without exception, that every building of any
importance has been copied from something belonging to a
country and a people foreign to the land in which it was
erected.</p>

<p>When the revival of Classic Literature began, Rome was
the first to feel its influence. It was welcomed there with
open arms, just as we might receive the early history and
literature of our country if it had all been lost and was
found again; for this was precisely what it meant to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
Romans, when, after the Dark Ages, the works of Livy,
Tacitus, and Cæsar were in their hands, and they read of
the history, art, and literature of their past. They were
enthusiastic, and their feeling soon spread over all Italy.</p>

<p>France was the next to adopt the newly-revived ideas,
for that country looked to Rome as the source of true religion,
and a model in all things. Spain was then in an unsettled
state, and welcomed the revival of classic art as
heartily as it had already embraced the Church of Rome.</p>

<p>In Germany the love of the classics was enthusiastic, but
that nation was more taken up with literature and slower in
adopting the revival of the arts than were the more southern
peoples, and the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries are a
barren period in the history of German architecture.</p>

<p>In England, too, the Renaissance made slow progress.
It was not until the time of Charles I. that any influence
was felt in Great Britain from the revival of classic taste
which was so well established on the Continent.</p>

<p>As it is true that no new order of Architecture has arisen
since the time of those of which I have already told you, I
shall try to make you understand something of Modern
Architecture by speaking of certain important edifices in one
country and another, with no attempt at any more detailed
explanation of it.</p>

<h3>ITALY.</h3>

<p>We cannot say that the art of the Renaissance originated
in one city or another, because the movement in the revival
of art was so general throughout Italy; but Florence has a
strong claim to our first consideration from the fact that
Filippo Brunelleschi was a Florentine and did his greatest
work in his native city, and on account of it has been called
"the father of the Art of the Renaissance." He was born
in 1377, and from his early boyhood was inclined to be an
architect. The cathedral of Florence (<a href="#illus102">Fig.&nbsp;102</a>), which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
also called the church of Sta. Maria del Fiore, had been
built long before, but had never been finished by a roof or
dome.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 547px;"><img id="illus102" src="images/illus102.jpg" width="547" height="361" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 102.&mdash;The Cathedral of Florence and Giotto's Campanile.</span></div></div>

<p>Brunelleschi was possessed with but one desire, which
was to complete this cathedral. He went to Rome and
diligently studied the remains of classic art which he found
there, and especially the dome of the Pantheon. Returning
to Florence he took measures to bring his plans before
the superintendents of the cathedral works; he was
ridiculed and discouraged on every hand, but he never gave
up his hopes nor lessened his study of the ways and means
by which the dome could be built. Thus many weary years
passed by; Brunelleschi made drawings in secret, and from
these he constructed models in order to convince himself of
what he could do.</p>

<p>At last those who had authority in the matter were
ready to act, and a convention was called, before which the
architects of different nations appeared and were requested
to explain their theories of what could be done to cover the
cathedral. Many artists were assembled and various plans
were shown, but after all had been examined the work was
given to Brunelleschi, and he was happy in finding that the
years he had devoted to the study of the dome had not
been spent in vain.</p>

<p>It was on this occasion that Brunelleschi refused to
show his models, and when the other architects blamed him
for this he asked that some eggs should be brought, and
proposed that he who could make an egg stand upright on
a smooth piece of marble should be the builder of the
dome. The others tried to do this and failed; at last
Brunelleschi brought his egg down on the marble with a
sharp tap and left it standing erect. Then all exclaimed,
"Oh, we could have done that if we had known that was
the way," to which Brunelleschi replied, "So you could
have built a dome if I had shown you my models."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
This story is often told of Columbus, but as Brunelleschi
was much older than Columbus, and the fact is related by
Florentine writers of his time, it is probable that Columbus
had heard of it from the geographer Toscanelli, who was a
great admirer of Brunelleschi and a friend of Columbus
also. In building the dome, Brunelleschi encountered great
difficulties, but he lived to be assured of his success, for at
his death, in 1444, it lacked but little of completion, and all
the parts essential to its perfection and durability were
finished.</p>

<p>This is the largest dome in the world, for though the
cross on the top of St. Peter's is farther from the ground
than that of Florence, the dome itself above the church is
not as large as the dome of Sta. Maria del
Fiore.</p>

<p>This work made Brunelleschi's greatest fame, but he
was the architect of many other fine churches and of secular
buildings also; among the last the Pitti Palace, in which is
the famous Pitti Gallery, is one of the most important.
When you go to Florence you will see a statue of Filippo
Brunelleschi, which is very interesting, on account of the
way in which it is represented and the position in which it
is placed. It is on one side of the Piazza of the cathedral;
he is calmly sitting there with a plan of the church spread
before him on his lap, while he lifts his head to look at the
great dome as it stands out against the sky, the realization
of all his thought and labor during so many
years.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 539px;"><img id="illus103" src="images/illus103.jpg" width="539" height="371" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 103.</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">View of St. Peter's.</span> <i>Rome.</i></div></div>

<p>The church of St. Peter's at Rome, which is the largest
and most magnificent of all Christian temples, was begun
about 1450, and was not brought into its present form until
about 1661, or more than two centuries later (<a href="#illus103">Fig.&nbsp;103</a>).</p>

<p>The history of its building is largely a story of contentions
and troubles between popes, architects, and artists of
different kinds. As it now stands it is as much the work
of Michael Angelo as of any one man, but several other
architects left their imprint upon it, both before and after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
his time; and all who aided in its construction were eminent
men, in their way. Michael Angelo was in his seventy-second
year when he took up the task of completing St.
Peter's. Bramante, Raphael, and Peruzzi had preceded
him as architects of the church; Michael Angelo designed
the dome, and when he was ninety it was nearly finished;
the models for its completion which he made were not
followed after his death; his plan would have made the
church more harmonious with the dome, in size, than it
now is. Money was sent in large sums, from all Europe,
to carry on this work; the finest materials were used in
building it, and the most gifted artists were employed in its
decoration; it is now the vast home of multitudes of treasures.
"I have hung the Pantheon in the air!" Michael
Angelo is said to have exclaimed, while looking at the
splendid dome of St. Peter's; and no dome in the world
has a more imposing effect, although its harmony with the
rest of the building is injured by the change of the plan
from that of a Greek cross which was made after his <span class="locked">death.<a name="FNanchor_A" id="FNanchor_A" href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">A</a></span></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_A" id="Footnote_A" href="#FNanchor_A" class="fnanchor">A</a>The interior diameter of the dome of St. Peter's is one hundred and
thirty-nine feet; that of St. Sophia, one hundred and fifteen feet, and that of
Sta. Maria del Fiore, at Florence, one hundred and thirty-eight feet, six
inches.</p></div>

<p>In spite of all this the critics of architecture are never
weary of pointing out the defects of St. Peter's; but to
those who cannot apply to it the test of strictly scientific
rules, its interior is sublime in its effect, and has few rivals&mdash;perhaps
but one&mdash;in the world, and that is the great
Hypostyle Hall at Karnak, of which we spoke when writing
of Egyptian architecture. But even here the difference is
almost too great to admit of comparison; the spirit of the
two is so unlike&mdash;St. Peter's is complete and Karnak is a
ruin&mdash;so, after all, it must be admitted that the interior of
St. Peter's is superior to all other edifices of which we
know (<a href="#illus104">Fig.&nbsp;104</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 384px;"><img id="illus104" src="images/illus104.jpg" width="384" height="556" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 104.&mdash;Section of St. Peter's.</span></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
From the time of the beginning of the Renaissance,
about 1420, to about 1630, the architecture of Venice was
going through a change, and finally reached such perfection
that during the next half century the most magnificent
style of architecture prevailed which has ever been known
there. We mean to say that the whole effect was the
grandest, for, while it is true that the edifices of that time
are stately and striking in their appearance, it is equally
true that their form and ornamentation are not as much in
keeping with their use as they had been in older edifices.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
Sansovino, who lived from 1479 to 1570, was an important
architect and had great influence upon modern Venetian
architecture. His masterpiece was the Library of St.
Mark, of which the preceding cut gives one end (<a href="#illus105">Fig.&nbsp;105</a>).
It is a very beautiful structure, and is made more interesting
from the fact that it stands directly opposite to the
Doge's Palace, and in the midst of all the interest which
centres about the Piazza of St. Mark.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 281px;"><img id="illus105" src="images/illus105.jpg" width="281" height="383" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 105.</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">East Elevation of Library of St. Mark.</span> <i>Venice.</i></div></div>

<p>The Ducal Palace at Venice is called by John Ruskin,
the great English critic, "the central edifice of the world."
It is divided into three stories, of which the uppermost
occupies rather more than half the height of the building.
The two lower stories are arcades of low, pointed arches,
supported on pillars, the one beneath being bolder and
heavier in character than the second. The capitals of the
columns are greatly varied, no two in the upper arcade
being exactly alike. Above the arches of the middle story
was a row of open-work spaces, of the form called quatrefoil;
while the third story is faced with alternating blocks
of rose-colored and white marble, and is pierced with a few
large pointed windows. The whole front, or façade, is
crowned by an open parapet made up of blocks of stone
carved into lily-like forms alternating with lance-shaped
leaves. The whole effect is one of great richness and
beauty, especially since time has mellowed its color,
and softened without destroying the whiteness of its
marbles (<a href="#illus106">Fig.&nbsp;106</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 464px;"><img id="illus106" src="images/illus106.jpg" width="464" height="395" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 106.&mdash;The Doge's Palace.</span> <i>Venice.</i></div></div>

<p>During the time of the Renaissance there were churches,
palaces, museums, hospitals, and other large buildings
erected in all the important cities of Italy. There are but
few of these which have such special features as entitle
them to be selected for description here. The reason for
this has been given already&mdash;viz.: there was nothing new
in them; they were all repetitions of what has been described
in one form or another. Perhaps the next cut gives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
as good an example of secular architecture in this age as
any that could be selected (<a href="#illus107">Fig.&nbsp;107</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 377px;"><img id="illus107" src="images/illus107.jpg" width="377" height="328" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 107.&mdash;Great Court of the Hospital of Milan.</span></div></div>

<p>Indeed, it is one of the most remarkable buildings of its
class in any age. It was commenced by Francesco Sforza
and his wife, Bianca, in 1456. They died long before its
completion, and one part and another have been changed
from time to time, but its great court, which was designed
by Bramante, still remains, the finest thing of its kind in all
Italy.</p>

<p>I shall now leave Italy with saying that the early days
of the Renaissance were the best days of Italian Architecture,
and, indeed, of Italian Art. The period made sacred
by the genius and works of Michael Angelo, Bramante,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
Sangallo, Leonardo da Vinci, and Raphael was a golden
era, and still sheds its lustre over the land of their nativity.
These artists followed the highest ideal of Art, and their errors
were superior to the so-called successes of less gifted men.</p>

<p>The Italian Art of the fifteenth century was individual
and grand; in the sixteenth century it became formal and
elegant; in the seventeenth century it was bizarre, over-ornamented,
and uncertain in its aim and execution; since
then it has been comparatively unimportant, and its architecture
scarcely merits censure, and certainly cannot be
praised.</p>

<h3>SPAIN.</h3>

<p>From the time of the fall of Granada, in 1492 to 1558,
Spain was the leading nation of Europe. The whole
country had been united under Ferdinand and Isabella, and
their reign was a glorious period for their country. The
importance of the nation was increased by the discovery of
the New World, and so many great men were in her councils
that her eminence was sure, and almost undisputed.
Thus it followed that during the first half of the sixteenth
century the Architecture of Spain gave expression to the
spirit by which the nation was then animated.</p>

<p>This did not long continue, however, for the iron, practical
rule of Philip II. crushed out enthusiasm and was fatal
to artistic inspiration. This sovereign desired only to extend
his kingdom; the priests, who acquired almost limitless
power under his reign, aimed only to strengthen their
authority, while the people were wildly pursuing riches in
the New World which opened up to them a vast and attractive
field. Thus no place or time was left to the cultivation
of Art, and the only noteworthy period of Spanish Architecture
since the beginning of the Renaissance was the sixty
years which we have mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
The Modern Architecture of Spain has been divided into
three eras, each of which was distinguished by its own
style. The first extends from the beginning of the Renaissance
down to that of the abdication of the great Emperor
Charles V. in 1555; the manner of this period is called
Platerisco, or the silversmith's style, on account of the vast
amount of fine, filigree ornament which was used. The
second period is from the above date to about 1650, and its
art is called the Græco-Roman style because it is an attempt
to revive the Classic Art of the ancient Greeks and Romans.
The third period comes from 1650 to about a century later,
and the Spaniards call its manner the Churrigueresque,
which difficult name they take from that of Josef de Churriguera,
the architect who invented this style. Since 1750
we may almost say that no such thing as Spanish Architecture
has existed.</p>

<p>The cathedrals of Granada, Jaen, and Valladolid, and
the churches of Malaga and Segovia, with many other
ecclesiastical edifices, are among the chief monuments of
Spanish Renaissance Architecture, but we shall pass on to
a little later period and speak of but one great achievement,
the famous Escurial, which is of much historic interest.</p>

<p>This combination of basilica, palace, monastery, and
college was begun in 1563 by Philip II., in accordance with
a vow which he made to St. Lawrence at the battle of St.
Quentin. This battle was fought in 1557 under the walls
of the French town of St. Quentin, by the French and the
Spaniards, and the latter were completely victorious.</p>

<p>This cut gives an idea of how grand and impressive this
collection of walls, towers, courts, and edifices must be, all
crowned with the dome of the basilica. It is almost like a
city by itself, and all who visit it agree that it is a gloomy
and depressing place in spite of its grandeur (<a href="#illus108">Fig.&nbsp;108</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 383px;"><img id="illus108" src="images/illus108.jpg" width="383" height="359" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 108.&mdash;The Escurial.</span> <i>Near Madrid.</i></div></div>

<p>The front has three imposing entrances, with towers at
the corner angles. Within the inclosure are a college,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
monastery, palace with state apartments, the church,
numerous courts, gardens, and fountains. The front is
injured by the great number of small windows, which divide
it into such numberless sections as to become very tiresome
to the eye, while they take away the noble elegance of
larger spaces and the air of repose which such spaces give.
The angle towers are not as rich in effect as they should be,
and the side walls have been compared to those of a Manchester
cotton-mill; thus the exterior, which is effective
from its size and general air, has not the beauty of detail
which satisfies a close observer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
The effect of the interior, as one goes in by the central
entrance, is all that can be desired. The court leads directly
to the square before the church; as one passes to it he has
the college on one side, the monastery on the other, farther
on the palace, with the whole culminating in the grand
state apartments and the basilica. The various courts are
striking in their arrangement, and the church with its dome
and towers gives a supreme glory to the whole. Gardens,
fountains, and many other fine objects add their effect to
the richness and beauty of the whole; but all are insignificant
beside the basilica, which merits a place in the foremost
rank of the churches of the Renaissance. Indeed, the
Escurial is a marvellous place, and is often called "the
eighth wonder of the world." The richest marbles, splendid
pictures, and many magnificent objects help to make it
one of the grandest works of modern architecture.</p>

<p>It is also true that it is one of the gloomiest places
visited by travellers, and I shall quote a few lines from De
Amicis to show the depressing effect which it has upon
those who go there.</p>

<p>"The first feeling is that of sadness; the whole building
is of dirt-colored stone, and striped with white between the
stones; the roofs are covered with strips of lead. It looks
like an edifice built of earth. The walls are very high and
bare, and contain a great number of loopholes. One would
call it a prison rather than a convent.... The locality,
the forms, the colors, everything, in fact, seems to have
been chosen by him who founded the edifice with the intention
of offering to the eyes of men a sad and solemn spectacle.
Before entering you have lost all your gayety; you
no longer smile, but think. You stop at the doors of the
Escurial with a sort of trepidation, as at the gates of a
deserted city; it seems to you that, if the terrors of the
Inquisition reigned in some corner of the world, they ought
to reign among those walls. You would say that therein<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
one might still see the last traces of it and hear its last
echo.... The royal palace is superb, and it is better to
see it before entering the convent and church, in order not
to confuse the separate impressions produced by each.
This palace occupies the northeast corner of the edifice.
Several rooms are full of pictures, others are covered from
floor to ceiling with tapestries, representing bull-fights,
public balls, games, fêtes, and Spanish costumes, designed
by Goya; others are regally furnished and adorned; the
floor, the doors, and the windows are covered with marvellous
inlaid work and stupendous gilding. But among all the
rooms the most noteworthy is that of Philip II.; it is
rather a cell than a room, is bare and squalid, with an alcove
which answers to the royal oratory of the church, so that,
from the bed, by keeping the doors open, one can see the
priest who is saying mass. Philip II. slept in that cell, had
his last illness there, and there he died. One still sees
some chairs used by him, two little stools upon which he
rested the leg tormented with gout, and a writing-desk.
The walls are white, the ceiling flat and without any ornament,
and the floor of brick.... In the court-yard of the
kings you can form a first idea of the immense frame-work
of the edifice. The court is inclosed by walls; on the side
opposite the doors is the façade of the church. On a
spacious flight of steps there are six enormous Doric columns,
each of which upholds a large pedestal, and every
pedestal a statue. There are six colossal statues, by Battiste
Monegro, representing Jehoshaphat, Ezekiel, David,
Solomon, Joshua, and Manasseh. The court-yard is paved,
scattered with bunches of damp turf. The walls look like
rocks cut in points; everything is rigid, massive, and
heavy, and presents the fantastic appearance of a Titanic
edifice, hewn out of solid stone, and ready to defy the
shocks of earth and the lightnings of heaven. There one
begins to understand what the Escurial really is.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
"One ascends the steps and enters the church. The
interior is sad and bare.... Beside the high altar, sculptured
and gilded in the Spanish style, in the inter-columns
of the two royal oratories, one sees two groups of bronze
statues kneeling, with their hands clasped toward the altar.
On the right Charles V. and the Empress Isabella, and
several princesses; on the left, Philip II. with his wives....
In a corner, near a secret door, is the chair which
Philip II. occupied. He received through that door letters
and important messages, without being seen by the priests
who were chanting in the choir. This church, which, in
comparison with the entire building, seems very small, is
nevertheless one of the largest in Spain, and although it
appears so free from ornamentation, contains immense
treasures of marble, gold, relics, and pictures, which the
darkness in part conceals, and from which the sad appearance
of the edifice distracts one's attention.... But every
feeling sinks into that of sadness. The color of the stone,
the gloomy light, and the profound silence which surrounds
you, recall your mind incessantly to the vastitude, unknown
recesses, and solitude of the building, and leave no room
for the pleasure of admiration. The aspect of the church
awakens in you an inexplicable feeling of inquietude. You
would divine, were you not otherwise aware of it, that
those walls are surrounded, for a great distance, by nothing
but granite, darkness, and silence; without seeing the
enormous edifice, you feel it; you feel that you are in the
midst of an uninhabited city; you would fain quicken your
pace in order to see it rapidly, to free yourself from the
weight of that mystery, and to seek, if they exist anywhere,
bright light, noise, and life.... One goes to the convent,
and here human imagination loses itself; ... you pass
through a long subterranean corridor, so narrow that you
can touch the walls with your elbows, low enough almost to
hit the ceiling with your head, and as damp as a submarine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
grotto; you reach the end, turn, and you are in another
corridor. You go on, come to doors, look, and other corridors
stretch away before you as far as the eye can reach.
At the end of some you see a ray of light, at the end of
others an open door, through which you catch a glimpse of
a suite of rooms.... You look through a door and start
back alarmed; at the end of that long corridor, into which
you have glanced, you have seen a man as motionless as a
spectre, who was looking at you. You proceed, and
emerge on a narrow court, inclosed by high walls, which is
gloomy, overgrown with weeds, and illumined by a faint
light which seems to fall from an unknown sun, like the
court of the witches described to us when we were children....
You pass through other corridors, staircases, suites of
empty rooms, and narrow courts, and everywhere there is
granite, a pale light, and the silence of a tomb. For a
short time you think you would be able to retrace your
steps; then your memory becomes confused, and you
remember nothing more; you seem to have walked ten
miles, to have been in that labyrinth for a month, and not
to be able to get out of it. You come to a court and say,
'I have seen it already!' but you are mistaken; it is
another.... You seem to be dreaming; catch glimpses
of long frescoed walls ornamented with pictures, crucifixes,
and inscriptions; you see and forget; and ask yourself,
'Where am I?'... On you go from corridor to corridor,
court to court; you look ahead with suspicion; almost
expect to see suddenly, at the turning of a corner, a row of
skeleton monks, with their hoods drawn over their eyes and
their arms folded; you think of Philip II., and seem to
hear his retreating step through dark hallways; you remember
all that you have read of him, of his treasures, the
Inquisition, and all becomes clear to your mind's eye; you
understand everything for the first time; the Escurial <i>is</i>
Philip II., he is still there, alive and frightful, and with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
him the image of his terrible God.... The Escurial surrounds,
holds, and overwhelms you; the cold of its stones
penetrates to your marrow; the sadness of its sepulchral
labyrinths invades your soul; if you are with a friend you
say, 'Let us leave;' if you were alone you would take to
flight. At last you mount a staircase, enter a room, go to
the window, and salute with a burst of gratitude the mountains,
sun, freedom, and the great and beneficent God who
loves and pardons. What a long breath one draws at that
window!</p>

<p>"An illustrious traveller said that after having passed a
day in the convent of the Escurial, one ought to feel happy
throughout one's life, in simply thinking that one might
still be among those walls, but is no longer there. This is
almost true. Even at the present day, after so great a lapse
of time, on rainy days, when I am sad, I think of the
Escurial, then look at the walls of my room, and rejoice!"</p>

<p>During the sixteenth century there were many palaces
erected in Spain, but nothing can be added to the impressions
you will get from the descriptions we have quoted of
the cheerful, gay Alhambra, and the gloomy, sad Escurial.</p>

<p>The domestic architecture of Spain is unattractive.
There are no fine <i>châteaux</i>, as in France, or elegant parks,
as in England. Ford compares the front of the residence
of the Duke of Medina to "ten Baker-street houses put
together," and this is true of many so-called palaces. This
state of modern Spanish architecture is fully accounted for
by the following quotation from Fergusson, the learned
writer on architecture:</p>

<p>"On the whole, perhaps, we should not be far wrong in
assuming that the Spaniards are among the least artistic
people in Europe. Great things have been done in their
country by foreigners, and they themselves have done
creditable things in periods of great excitement, and under
the pressure of foreign example; but in themselves they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
seem to have no innate love of Art, no real appreciation for
its beauties, and, when left to themselves, they care little
for the expression of beauty in any of the forms in which
Art has learned to embody itself. In Painting they have
done some things that are worthy of praise; in Sculpture
they have done very little; and in Architectural Art they
certainly have not achieved success. Notwithstanding that
they have a climate inviting to architectural display in every
form; though they have the best of materials in infinite
abundance; though they had wealth and learning, and were
stimulated by the example of what had been done in their
own country, and was doing by other nations&mdash;in spite of
all this, they have fallen far short of what was effected
either in Italy or France, and now seem to be utterly incapable
of appreciating the excellencies of Architectural
Art, or of caring to enjoy them."</p>

<h3>FRANCE.</h3>

<p>After the reigns of Charles VIII. and Louis XII. the
French people became somewhat familiar with Italian Art,
and at length, during the reign of Francis I., from 1515 to
1546, everything Italian was the fashion in France. Francis
invited such artists as Leonardo da Vinci, Benvenuto
Cellini, Primaticcio, and Andrea del Sarto to come to
France and aid him in his works at Fontainebleau and elsewhere.</p>

<p>It was not long before the Gothic architecture which
had been so much used and improved in France was
thought to be inferior in beauty to the Italian architecture
as it existed in the sixteenth century, and very soon the
latter style was adopted and considered as the only one
worthy of admiration. But the French architects had been
so trained to the Gothic order that it was not easy for them
to change their habits of design, and the result was that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
new edifices were largely of the Gothic form, but were
finished and ornamented like the Italian buildings; by this
means the effect of the whole, when completed, was such
as is seen in this picture of the church of St. Michael at
Dijon (<a href="#illus109">Fig.&nbsp;109</a>). In these days no one approves of this
union of Gothic design and Italian decoration, but when
it was the fashion it was thought to be very beautiful
by French architects.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 398px;"><img id="illus109" src="images/illus109.jpg" width="398" height="519" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 109.&mdash;Façade of the Church of St. Michael.</span> <i>Dijon.</i></div></div>

<p>Francis I., who was so anxious to introduce Italian art
into France, erected edifices of a very different sort from
those which he attempted to imitate. In Italy, the principal
buildings of the Renaissance were churches or convents,
or such as were in some way for religious uses.
Francis I. built palaces like that of Fontainebleau, and splendid
châteaux like those of Chambord, or Chenonceaux, and
the Italian style of architecture could not be readily adapted
to the lighter uses of the French kings. The splendid
massive Pitti Palace, built after the design of the great
Brunelleschi, would scarcely have harmonized with the river
banks and the lovely undulating meadows around a country
villa or château. So it gradually happened that French
Architecture was more graceful, light, and elegant than the
architecture of the churches, monasteries, and other religious
edifices of Italy, and at the same time the Italian
feeling and influence can easily be traced in the French
buildings of the time of which we speak.</p>

<p>In Italy the Pope and the Church governed in Art, and
considered it only as a religious means of glorifying the
Church and impressing its doctrines upon the whole people.
In France the sovereigns held the leading place, and in the
midst of their ambitions and their gayeties they found little
time to consider the matter of church architecture.
Though the church of St. Eustache was erected at Paris,
and other churches were restored, it was not until 1629,
when Cardinal Richelieu ordered the building of the church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
of the Sarbonne, that an example was given of the full
effects upon French church architecture of the change
from the Gothic, or Mediæval style, to that of the Renaissance,
or the Classic style.</p>

<p>Perhaps the church of the Invalides is the most remarkable
building of the seventeenth century in France. It was
designed and superintended by Jules Hardouin Mansard, a
skilful architect, who was born in 1647, and died in 1708.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
The erection of the dome of the Invalides occupied him
from 1680 to 1706. It is a fashion to criticise this as well
as all famous buildings, but if it is remembered that the
dome was intended to be <i>the feature</i> of the edifice, and that
it was therefore necessary to sacrifice something to it, in the
construction of the whole, we must admit that what its
admirers claim for it is true&mdash;namely, that it is one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
finest domical edifices in Europe, and a most satisfactory
example of the architecture of its class (<a href="#illus110">Fig.&nbsp;110</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 402px;"><img id="illus110" src="images/illus110.jpg" width="402" height="427" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 110.&mdash;Façade of the Dome of the Invalides.</span> <i>Paris.</i></div></div>

<p>Directly underneath this dome is the crypt in which is
the sarcophagus which contains the remains of Napoleon
Bonaparte. On the door which leads to the crypt are inscribed
the following words, taken from the will of the exile
at St. Helena: "I desire that my ashes may rest on the
banks of the Seine, in the midst of the French people whom
I have loved so well."</p>

<p>This tomb is said to have cost nearly two millions of
dollars, and though it is beautiful, and in good taste in its
details, yet one can but regret that all this expense should
not have erected a splendid mausoleum, such as would have
dignified the monumental art of France.</p>

<p>The church of St. Genevieve, or the Pantheon, as it is
usually called, is a very important architectural work. It
was twenty-six years in building, and was not completed
until after the death of its architect, Soufflot, which occurred
in 1781 (<a href="#illus111">Fig.&nbsp;111</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 378px;"><img id="illus111" src="images/illus111.jpg" width="378" height="429" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 111.&mdash;The Pantheon.</span> <i>Paris.</i></div></div>

<p>It is said that this church was begun as the fulfilment of
a vow made by King Louis XV. when he was ill, but as the
French Revolution was in progress when it was completed,
it was dedicated to the "<i>Grands Hommes</i>," or the great
men of France, and not to God or the sweet St. Genevieve,
who was one of the patron saints of Paris.</p>

<p>The dome of the Pantheon is elegant and chaste, but
not great in design or effect, and the whole appearance of
the church is weakened by the extreme width of the spaces
between the front columns; this makes the entablature
appear weak, and is altogether a serious defect. Another
striking fault is the way in which a second column is placed
outside at each end of the portico; one cannot imagine a
reason for this, and it is confusing and unmeaning in the
extreme. The interior of the Pantheon is superior to the
exterior, and many authorities name it as the most satisfactory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
of all modern, classical church interiors; when it
was built it was believed to be as perfect an imitation of
antique classical architecture as could be made, and all the
world may be grateful that it escaped the fate prepared for
it by the Communists. This was averted by the discovery
and cutting of the fuse which they had prepared for its
destruction on May 24th, 1871; the fuse led to the crypts
beneath the church, where these reckless men had placed
large quantities of powder.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the present century French architects
believed it best to reproduce exactly ancient temples
which had been destroyed. According to this view the
church of the Madeleine was begun in 1804, after the
designs of Vignon. Outwardly it is a temple of the Corinthian
order, and is very beautiful, though its position
greatly lessens its effect. If it were on a height, or standing
in a large square by itself, it would be far more imposing
(<a href="#illus112">Fig.&nbsp;112</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 460px;"><img id="illus112" src="images/illus112.jpg" width="460" height="291" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 112.&mdash;The Madeleine.</span> <i>Paris.</i></div></div>

<p>The church of the Trinity and that of the Augustines,
at Paris, are important church edifices of the present day,
but though much thought and time have been lavished on
them, they are not as attractive as we could wish the works
of our own time to be; and they seem almost unworthy of
attention when we remember that in the same city there are
so many examples of architecture that have far more artistic
beauty, as well as the additional charms of age and the
interest of historical associations.</p>

<p>We have already spoken of the sort of building in which
Francis I. delighted. Of all his undertakings the rebuilding
of the Louvre was the most successful. Its whole design
was fine and the ornaments beautiful; many of these
decorations were made after the drawings of Jean Goujon,
who was an eminent master in such sculptures. The court
of the Louvre has never been excelled in any country of
Europe; it is a wonderful work for the time in which it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
was built, and satisfies the taste of the most critical observers
(<a href="#illus113">Fig.&nbsp;113</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 417px;"><img id="illus113" src="images/illus113.jpg" width="417" height="331" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 113.&mdash;Pavilion de l'Horloge and Part of the Court of The Louvre.</span></div></div>

<p>We cannot give space to descriptions of the châteaux
built by Francis I., but this picture of that of Chambord
affords a good example of what these buildings were
(<a href="#illus114">Fig.&nbsp;114</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 564px;"><img id="illus114" src="images/illus114.jpg" width="564" height="409" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 114.&mdash;Château of Chambord.</span></div></div>

<p>From the time of the reign of Charles IX. (1560) to the
close of the reign of Louis XIII., the style of architecture
which was used in France was called the "style of Henry
IV.;" this last-named king ruled before Louis XIII., and
during his time architecture sank to a very low plane&mdash;there
was nothing in it to admire or imitate. Under Louis XIII.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
it began to improve, and in the days of Louis XIV., who
is called the "<i>Grand Monarque</i>," all the arts made great
progress and received much patronage from the king, and
all the people of the court, for whom the king was a model.
Louis XIV. began a revival of Roman classical architecture,
and there is no doubt that he believed that he
equalled, or perhaps excelled, Julius Cæsar and all other
Roman emperors as a patron of the Fine Arts.</p>

<p>But we know that this great monarch was deceived by
his self-love and by the flatteries of those who surrounded
him and wished to obtain favors from him. His architectural
works had so many faults that it is very tiresome to
read what is written about them, and in any case it is
pleasanter to speak of virtues than of faults. The works
of Louis XIV. were certainly herculean, and when we
think of the building of the palace of Versailles, the completion
of the Louvre, and the numberless hôtels, châteaux,
and palaces which belong to his reign, we feel sure that if
only the vastness of the architectural works of his time is
considered, he well merits the title of the Great Monarch.
But these important edifices require more time and space if
spoken of in detail than we can give, and I pass to some
consideration of the works of our own time.</p>

<p>The architecture of the reign of Napoleon III. requires
the space of a volume, at least, were it to be clearly described,
for during that reign there was scarcely a city of
France that did not add some important building to its
public edifices. First, the city of Paris was remodelled and
rebuilt to a marvellous extent, and as in other matters Paris
is the leader, so its example was followed in architecture.
The new Bourse in Lyons, the Custom House at Rouen,
and the Exchange at Marseilles are good specimens of what
was done in this way outside the great metropolis.</p>

<p>During the reign of Louis Philippe, and a little later,
French domestic architecture was vastly improved, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
since then much more attention has been given by Frenchmen
to the houses in which they live. The appearance of
the new Boulevards and streets of Paris is picturesque, while
the houses are rich and elegant. Many portions of this
city are more beautiful than any other city of Europe; and
yet it is true that the architecture of forty years or so ago
was more satisfactory than that of the present time.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 376px;"><img id="illus115" src="images/illus115.jpg" width="376" height="279" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 115.&mdash;Porte St. Denis.</span> <i>Paris.</i></div></div>

<p>The French are an enthusiastic people, and have been
very fond of erecting monuments in public places which
would remind them continually of the glories of their
nation, the conquests of their armies, and the achievements
of their great men. Triumphal Arches and Columns of
Victory are almost numberless in France; many of them
are impressive, and some are really very fine in their architecture.
Since the Porte St. Denis was (<a href="#illus115">Fig.&nbsp;115</a>) erected, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
1672, almost every possible design has been used for these
monuments, in one portion of France or another, until,
finally, the Arc de l'Étoile (<a href="#illus116">Fig.&nbsp;116</a>) was built at the upper
end of the Champs Elysées, at Paris. This is the noblest
of all modern triumphal arches, as well as one of the most
splendid ornaments in a city which is richly decorated with
architectural works of various styles and periods&mdash;from that
of the fine Renaissance example seen in the west front of
the Louvre, built in 1541, down to the Arc de l'Étoile, the
Fontaine St. Michel, and the Palais du Trocadéro of our
own time.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 342px;"><img id="illus116" src="images/illus116.jpg" width="342" height="322" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 116.&mdash;Arc de l'Étoile.</span> <i>Paris.</i></div></div>

<p>The French architecture of the present century is in
truth a classic revival; its style has been called the <i>néo-Grec</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
or revived Greek, and the principal buildings of the
reign of Napoleon III. all show that a study of Greek art
had influenced those who designed these edifices.</p>

<h3>ENGLAND.</h3>

<p>We may say that England has never had an architecture
of its own, since it has always imitated and reproduced the
orders which have originated in other countries. The
Gothic order is more than any other the order of England,
and, in truth, of Great Britain. All English cathedrals,
save one, and a very large proportion of the churches, in
city and country, are built in this style of architecture.</p>

<p>It is also true that during the Middle Ages, when the
Roman Catholics were in power in England and made use
of Gothic architecture, they built so many churches, that,
during several later centuries, it might be truly said that
England had no church architecture, because so few new
churches were required or built.</p>

<p>It is so difficult to trace the origin and progress of the
Classical or Renaissance feeling in English architecture that
I shall leave it altogether, and passing the transition style
and period, speak directly of the first great architect of the
Renaissance in England, Inigo Jones, who was born in 1572
and died in 1653. He studied in Italy and brought back
to his native country a fondness for the Italian architecture
of that day. He became the favorite court architect, and
there are many important edifices in England which were
built from his designs. His most notable work was the
palace of Whitehall, though his design was never fully carried
out in it; had it been, this palace would have excelled
all others in Europe, either of earlier or later date. Among
the churches designed by Inigo Jones that of St. Paul's,
Covent Garden, is interesting because it is probably the first
important Protestant church erected in England which still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
exists. It is small and simple, being almost an exact reproduction
of the early Greek temples called <i>distyle in antis</i>,
such as I described when speaking of Greek architecture
(<a href="#illus117">Fig.&nbsp;117</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 269px;"><img id="illus117" src="images/illus117.jpg" width="269" height="111" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 117.&mdash;East Elevation of St. Paul's.</span> <i>Covent Garden.</i></div></div>

<p>Inigo Jones made many designs for villas and private
residences, and perhaps he is more famous for these works
than for any others. Among them are Chiswick and Wilton
House, and many others of less importance.</p>

<p>After Jones came Sir Christopher Wren, who was the
architect of some of the finest buildings in London. He
was born in 1632 and died in 1723. The great fire, in
1666, when he was thirty-four years old, gave him a splendid
opportunity to show his talents. Only three days after
this fire he presented to the king a plan for rebuilding the
city, which would have made it one of the most convenient
as well as one of the most beautiful cities of the world.</p>

<p>Sir Christopher Wren is most frequently mentioned as
the architect of St. Paul's Cathedral. This was commenced
nine years after the great fire, and was thirty-five years in
building. St. Paul's is the largest and finest Protestant
cathedral in the world, and among all the churches of
Europe that have been erected since the revival of Classical
architecture, St. Peter's, at Rome, alone excels it (<a href="#illus118">Fig.&nbsp;118</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 394px;"><img id="illus118" src="images/illus118.jpg" width="394" height="418" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 118.&mdash;St. Paul's, London.</span> <i>From the West.</i></div></div>

<p>Although so many years were consumed in the building
of St. Paul's, Sir Christopher Wren lived to superintend it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
all, and had the gratification of placing the topmost stone
in the lantern of this splendid monument to his genius.</p>

<p>The western towers of Westminster Abbey are said to
have been built after a design by Wren, but of this there is
a doubt. Among his other works in church architecture
are the steeple of Bow Church, London; the church of St.
Stephen's, Walbrook; St. Bride's, Fleet Street, and St.
James's, Piccadilly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
The royal palaces of Winchester and Hampton were
designed by Wren, and many other well-known edifices,
among which is Greenwich Hospital. He made some
signal failures, but it is great praise to say, what is undoubtedly
true, that, though he was a pioneer in the Renaissance
architecture of England, and died a century and a
half ago, no one of his countrymen has surpassed him, and
we may well question whether any other English architect
has equalled him.</p>

<p>Churches, palaces, university buildings, and fine examples
of municipal and domestic architecture are so
numerous in England and other portions of Great Britain
that we cannot speak of them in detail. The culmination
of the taste for the imitation of Classical architecture was
reached about the beginning of the present century, and
among the most notable edifices in that manner are the
British Museum, Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge, and St.
George's Hall, Liverpool (<a href="#illus119">Fig.&nbsp;119</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
A revival of Gothic Architecture has taken place in
England in our own time. The three most prominent
secular buildings in this style are Windsor Castle, the
Houses of Parliament, and the New Museum, at Oxford.
Of course, in the case of Windsor Castle, the work was a
remodelling, but the reparations were so extensive as to
almost equal a rebuilding. Sir Jeffry Wyatville had the
superintendence of it, and succeeded in making it appear
like an ancient building refitted in the nineteenth century&mdash;that
is to say, it combines modern luxury and convenience
in its interior with the exterior appearance of the castellated
fortresses of a more barbarous age (<a href="#illus120">Fig.&nbsp;120</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 408px;"><img id="illus120" src="images/illus120.jpg" width="408" height="249" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 120.&mdash;Windsor Castle.</span></div></div>

<p>In the Houses of Parliament there was an attempt to
carry out, even to the minutest detail, the Gothic style as
it existed in the Tudor age, when there was an excess of
ornament, most elaborate doorways, and the fan-tracery
vaultings were decorated with pendent ornaments which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
look like clusters of stalactites. Sir Charles Barry was its
architect. The present school of artists in England are
never weary of abusing it; they call it a horror and declare
its style to be obsolete. In fact, it is not the success at
which Barry aimed; but it excels the other efforts to revive
the Gothic in this day, not only in England, but in all
Europe, and has many points to be admired in its plan and
its detail, while the beauty of its sky-line must be admitted
by all (<a href="#illus121">Fig.&nbsp;121</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 375px;"><img id="illus121" src="images/illus121.jpg" width="375" height="270" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 121.&mdash;The Houses of Parliament.</span> <i>London.</i></div></div>

<p>In the New Museum of Oxford, the Gothic is that of
Lombardy, rather than the Early English. It is an example
of the result of the teaching of Mr. Ruskin. It does
not realize the expectations of those who advocated this
manner of building, and has proved a great disappointment
to the advanced theorists of a quarter of a century ago.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
English architecture of the present day may be concisely
described by saying that it is Gothic for churches, parsonage-houses,
school-houses, and all edifices in which the
clergy are interested or of which they have the oversight.
On the other hand, palaces, town-halls, municipal buildings,
club-houses, and such structures as come within the
care of the laity, are almost without exception in the
Classic style.</p>

<p>Neither of these orders seems to be exactly suited to the
climate of England or to the wants of its people; therefore,
neither would satisfy the demands of the ancients, who
taught that the architecture of a nation should be precisely
adapted to its climate and to the purposes for which the
edifices are intended. In fact, the ancients carried their
ideas of fitness so far that one could tell at a glance the
object for which a structure had been designed; we know
that it is not possible to comply with this law in this day,
although it is doubtless in accord with the true ideal of
what perfect architecture should be. At the present day
there is little doubt that the edifices of the Church and
clergy are far more praiseworthy and true architecturally
than are those for secular and domestic uses.</p>

<h3>GERMANY.</h3>

<p>I shall not speak of the period of the Renaissance in
Germany, but shall go forward to the time of the Revival
of Classic Architecture, which dated about 1825. During
the eighteenth century the discoveries which were made in
Greece were of great interest to all the world, and the drawings
which were made of the temples and monuments, as
well as of the lesser objects of art which existed there, were
sent all over Europe, and had such an effect upon the
different nations, that with one accord they began to adopt
the Greek style of architecture, whenever any important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
work was to be done. This effect was very marked in Germany,
and the German architects tried to copy every detail
of Greek architecture with great exactness.</p>

<p>When we begin to speak of modern German architecture
at this point, we do not omit anything important, for
the struggles of the Reformation, and the results of the
Thirty Years' War were such, that no great architectural
advances were attempted for a long time. Again, the
division of Germany into many small principalities, and the
establishment of many little courts so divided the wealth of
the German people into small portions, that no one was rich
enough to undertake large buildings. There was no one
great central city as in France and England, and no one
sovereign was rich enough to adorn his capital with splendid
edifices or to be a magnificent patron of art and artists
after the fashion of the "<i>Grand Monarque</i>" in France.</p>

<p>Before taking up the Revival, however, I wish, for two
reasons, to give a picture of the Brandenburg Gate, at
Berlin. This gate was erected between 1784 and 1792. It
is important because such monuments are more rare in Germany
than in other European countries, especially of the
time in which this was built, and because it is one of the
best imitations of Greek art that exists in any nation (<a href="#illus122">Fig.&nbsp;122</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 335px;"><img id="illus122" src="images/illus122.jpg" width="335" height="315" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 122.&mdash;The Brandenburg Gate.</span> <i>Berlin.</i></div></div>

<p>It is interesting to remember that when Napoleon
entered Berlin as a conqueror, after the Battle of Jena, he
sent the Car of Victory, which surmounts this gate, to Paris,
as a trophy of his prowess. After his abdication it was
returned to its original position.</p>

<p>The effect of the German revival of Greek art is more
plainly seen in Munich than in any other city. It is the
capital of Bavaria, and one of its kings, Louis I., while he
was young and had not yet become king, resided at Rome;
he was a passionate lover of art, and he resolved that
when he came to the throne he would make his capital
famous for beautiful things. Above all, he desired to imitate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
all that he had most admired in the countries he had
visited, and also the art of the ancients as he knew it from
models and pictures. For this reason it happens that
Munich is a collection of copies of buildings which have
existed in other countries and in past ages, and as these
buildings, which were first made in marble and stone, are
mostly copied in plaster in Munich, much of their beauty is
lost; and since these copied buildings are not used for the
same purposes for which the ancient ones were intended,
the whole effect of them is very far from pleasing or satisfactory.
In fact, the result is just such as must always
follow the imitation of a beautiful object, when no proper
regard is paid to the use to be made of it. If, for example,
a fine copy of a light and airy Swiss châlet should be made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
in the United States of America, and placed on some business
street in one of our cities, and used for a bank building,
we could not deny that it was an exact copy of a building
which is good in its way; but it would be so unsuited
to its position and its uses, that the man who built it there
would be counted as insane or foolish. And this is the
effect of the modern architecture of Munich; it seems as
if King Louis must have been a madman to expend so
much time and money in this absurd kind of imitative
architecture, and yet it is very interesting to visit this city
and see these edifices.</p>

<p>Of the Munich churches erected under Louis I. that of
St. Ludwig is in the Byzantine order; the Aue-Kirche is in
the pointed German Gothic, and the Basilica is like a
Roman basilica of the fifth century. It resembles that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
St. Paul's-without-the-Walls; it was begun in 1835 and
completed in 1850. In a vault beneath this basilica Louis
and his Queen, Theresa, are buried. The picture given
here shows its extreme simplicity; its whole effect is solemn
and satisfactory; still one must regret that since it is so fine
up to a certain point, it should not have been made still finer
(<a href="#illus123">Fig.&nbsp;123</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 274px;"><img id="illus123" src="images/illus123.jpg" width="274" height="293" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 123.&mdash;The Basilica at Munich.</span></div></div>

<p>The Ruhmeshalle, or Hall of Fame, at Munich, is an
interesting and somewhat unique edifice. It is a portico
of marble with forty-eight Doric columns, each twenty-six
feet high. Against the walls are brackets holding busts of
celebrated Germans who have lived since 1400. In front
of the portico stands the colossal bronze statue of Bavaria.
She is represented as a protectress with a lion by her side;
in the right hand she holds a sword, and a chaplet in the
left; it is sixty-one and a half feet high, and the pedestal
raises it twenty-eight and a half feet more; inside, a staircase
leads up into the head, where there are seats for eight
persons. The view from the top of this statue is fine, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
so extensive that in a favorable atmosphere the heights of
the Alps can be discerned. The hill upon which the
Ruhmeshalle is built is to the south of Munich, and is
called the Theresienhöhe. The grand statue is intended to
be the principal object of interest here, and the portico is
made so low as to throw the figure out and show it off to
advantage; altogether it is one of the most successful architectural
works in Munich (<a href="#illus124">Fig.&nbsp;124</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 395px;"><img id="illus124" src="images/illus124.jpg" width="395" height="226" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 124.&mdash;The Ruhmeshalle.</span> <i>Near Munich.</i></div></div>

<p>The Glyptothek, or Sculpture Gallery, the Pinakothek,
or Picture Gallery, the Royal Palace, the Public Library,
the War Office, the University, Blind School, other palaces
and secular buildings, all belong to the time of the Revival
in Germany. The Ludwig Strasse, which King Louis
fondly hoped to make one of the most beautiful avenues in
the world, is&mdash;with its Roman arch at one end, and a weak
copy of the Loggia dei Lanzi at the other&mdash;a tiresome,
meaningless, architectural failure.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 377px;"><img id="illus125" src="images/illus125.jpg" width="377" height="181" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 125.&mdash;The Museum.</span> <i>Berlin.</i></div></div>

<p>The Museum of Berlin is a striking result of the same
Revival of Classic architecture, and is far more splendid
than anything in Munich (<a href="#illus125">Fig.&nbsp;125</a>).</p>

<p>In Dresden the most important works in this style are
the New Theatre and Picture Gallery. The last is almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
an exact reproduction of the Pinakothek of Munich. All
over Germany the effects of this Revival are more or less
prominent, but I shall speak of but one other edifice, the
Walhalla (<a href="#illus126">Fig.&nbsp;126</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 402px;"><img id="illus126" src="images/illus126.jpg" width="402" height="233" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 126.&mdash;The Walhalla.</span></div></div>

<p>This is also a Temple of Fame, and is situated about six
miles from Ratisbon. It overlooks the River Danube from
a height of more than three hundred feet. It was begun in
1830, and was twelve years in building, costing eight millions
of florins. It is of white marble, and on the exterior
is an exact reproduction of the Parthenon at Athens. The
interior is divided into two parts by an entablature, which
supports fourteen caryatides, made from colored marbles.
These figures in turn support a second entablature, on
which is a frieze in eight compartments, on which is sculptured
scenes representing the history of Germany from its
early days to the time of the introduction of Christianity.
Along the lower wall there are one hundred busts of illustrious
Germans who had lived from the earliest days of Germany
down to those of the poet Goethe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
The grounds about the Walhalla are laid out in walks,
and from them there are fine, extensive views. Taken by
itself there is much to admire in the Walhalla. The sculptures
arouse an enthusiasm about Germany, her history,
and the men who have helped to make it, in spite of the
strange unfitness with which the artists have mingled
Grecian myths and German sagas. But aside from this
sort of interest the whole thing seems incongruous and
strangely unsuited to its position; one writer goes so far as
to say of it that "Minerva, descending in Cheapside to
separate two quarrelling cabmen, could hardly be more out
of place." And yet it is true that the Walhalla is the only
worthy rival to St. George's Hall, Liverpool, as an example
of the possible adaptability of Greek or Roman Architecture
to the needs and uses of our own days.</p>

<p class="p1">The Opera House of La Scala, at Milan, is generally said
to be the finest of all for seeing and hearing what goes on
upon the stage: it was begun in 1776 and finished two
years later. San Carlo, Naples, holds the second place,
and was first erected in 1737, but was almost destroyed by
fire in 1816, and was afterward thoroughly rebuilt.</p>

<p>The new Opera House of Paris is interesting to us
because it has been built so recently and so much written
and said of it that we are familiar with it. Any description
that would do it justice would occupy more space than we
can afford for it, but this cut (<a href="#illus127">Fig.&nbsp;127</a>) gives an excellent
idea of its size and exterior appearance. It is distinguished
by great richness of material and profusion of ornament,
its interior decorations being especially splendid. It has
been criticised as lacking repose and dignity, but its elegance
and magnificence compel admiration.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 376px;"><img id="illus127" src="images/illus127.jpg" width="376" height="242" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 127.&mdash;The New Opera House.</span> <i>Paris.</i></div></div>

<p>Music halls are only another sort of theatre, and have
come into great favor in recent days, especially in England.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
The Albert Hall, South Kensington, is the finest music hall
that has been erected. It seats eight thousand people,
besides accommodating an orchestra of two hundred and a
chorus of one thousand singers; it is one hundred and
thirty-six feet from the floor to the highest part of the ceiling.
This hall has some defects, but is so far successful as
to prove that a theatre or music hall could be so constructed
as to seat ten thousand persons and permit them to hear
the music as distinctly as it is heard in many halls where
only two or three thousand can be comfortable.</p>

<h3>UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.</h3>

<p>When we remember that we have been able to give
some account of architecture as it existed thousands of
years before Christ, and to speak of the temples and
tombs of the grand old nations who laid the foundation of
the arts and civilization of the world&mdash;and then, when we
remember the little time that has passed since the first roof
was raised in our own land, we may well be proud of our
country as it is&mdash;and at the same time we know that its
architecture may in truth be said to be a thing of the
future.</p>

<p>It is but a few years, not more than seventy, since any
building existed here that could be termed architectural in
any degree. To be sure, there were many comfortable,
generous-sized homes scattered up and down the land, but
they made no claim to architectural design, and were not
such edifices as one considers when speaking or writing of
architecture.</p>

<p>The first buildings to which much attention was given
in the United States were the Capitols, both State and
National, and until recently they were in what may be
called a Classic style, because they had porticoes with columns
and certain other features of ancient orders; but when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
the cella, as is the
case in America, is
divided into two or
more stories, with
rows of prosaic windows
all around, and
chimneys, and perhaps
attics also added,
the term Classic
Architecture immediately
becomes questionable,
and it is
difficult to find a
name exactly suited
to the needs of the
case; for it is still
true that from a distance,
and in answer
to a general glance,
they are nearer to
the Classic orders
than to anything else.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 548px;"><img id="illus128" src="images/illus128.jpg" width="548" height="210" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 128.&mdash;The United States Capitol.</span> <i>Washington.</i></div></div>

<p>The National Capitol
at Washington,
which is the principal
edifice in the United
States, was begun in
1793, when General
Washington laid the
foundation-stone;
the main portion was
completed in 1830;
two wings and the
dome have since been
added, and its present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
size is greater than that of any other legislative building
in the world, except the British Houses of Parliament
(<a href="#illus128">Fig.&nbsp;128</a>).</p>

<p>The dome, and the splendid porticoes, with the magnificent
flights of steps leading up to them, are the fine features
of the Capitol. The dome compares well with those
that are famous in the world, and taken all in all the Washington
Capitol is more stately than the Houses of Parliament,
and is open to as little criticism as buildings of its
class in other lands.</p>

<p>Several of the State Capitols illustrate the manner of
building which I described above. This cut of the Capitol
of Ohio is an excellent example of it (<a href="#illus129">Fig.&nbsp;129</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 374px;"><img id="illus129" src="images/illus129.jpg" width="374" height="276" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 129&mdash;State Capitol.</span> <i>Columbus, Ohio.</i></div></div>

<p>In domestic architecture, while there has been no style
so original and absolutely defined as to be definitely called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
American, we may roughly classify three periods&mdash;the
Colonial, the Middle, and the Modern. These terms have
no close application, and you must understand that I use
them rather for convenience than because they accurately,
or even approximately, indicate particular styles. The mansions
of the Colonial period are, perhaps, most easily recognized,
and in some respects were the frankest and most
independent class of houses ever built in this country. The
early settlers took whatever suited them from all styles, and
instead of imitating the English, the Dutch, or the French
manner of building, mingled parts of all, with especial reference
to the needs of their climate and surroundings.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 545px;"><img id="illus130" src="images/illus130.jpg" width="545" height="376" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 130.&mdash;Sir William Pepperell's House.</span> <i>Kittery Point, Maine.</i></div></div>

<p>This fine old house (<a href="#illus130">Fig.&nbsp;130</a>) shows the plain, homely, yet
quaint style of many of the mansions of the Colonial period.
It was built near the beginning of the last century, and occupied
by Sir William Pepperell until his death. Its interior,
with heavy wainscoting of solid mahogany, was more
imposing by far than the exterior. The Van Rensselaer
homestead at Albany is an excellent example of a more
stately house, possessing much dignity and impressiveness.</p>

<p>The Middle period was a time when domestic architecture,
still without any originality and losing much of the
independence of the Colonial, copied more closely from
foreign models. Some fine old mansions belong to this
period, which covered the last years of the last century and
the first half of this. The celebrated Cragie House at Cambridge,
occupied by the poet Longfellow; "Elmwood,"
the home of James Russell Lowell; "Bedford House," in
Westchester County, New York, the home of the Hon.
John Jay, are to be referred to this period; and so is the
imposing "Old Morrisania," at Morrisania, New York, the
old Morris mansion (<a href="#illus131">Fig.&nbsp;131</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 561px;"><img id="illus131" src="images/illus131.jpg" width="561" height="385" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 131.&mdash;"Old Morrisania."</span> <i>Morrisania, New York.</i></div></div>

<p>It is modelled after a French château, and was erected
by General Morris after his return from France in 1800. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
is one of the most striking among the mansions of its time,
and both its interior and exterior are highly interesting.</p>

<p>These views serve to illustrate the want of anything like
a regular style, of which I spoke above; but they show
how many different forces were at work to influence building
in the Modern period. This division is meant to extend
to and include the present time, and so great is the
diversity of styles now employed that in a work like this it
would be idle to attempt anything like an enumeration of
them, and still less to try and determine their origin and
importance. I can only give you one example of the handsome
and costly homes which are being built to-day, and
leave you to observe others as you now see them everywhere
about the country (<a href="#illus132">Fig.&nbsp;132</a>). A modern writer on American
architecture claims that in private dwellings an American
order is gradually being developed by the changes made to
adapt foreign forms to our climate, and especially to the
brilliancy of the sunlight here. All this is so difficult to
define, however, that it would be impossible to show it
clearly in the limits of a book like this, even if it exists.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 539px;"><img id="illus132" src="images/illus132.jpg" width="539" height="391" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 132.&mdash;Residence at Irvington, New York.</span></div></div>

<p>What is called the "Queen Anne" style, modelled upon
the English fashion of the time of that monarch, is very
widely used in country houses at the present time, sometimes
in conjunction with the Colonial, which also exists as
an independent style. The tendency of domestic architecture
is to make everything quaint and picturesque, though
this is not so far carried to extremes as was the case a few
years since.</p>

<p>In public buildings many splendid edifices have been
erected of late years. The imitation of classic forms which
was formerly the fashion, and which is so strikingly exhibited
by Girard College, Philadelphia, is now almost
entirely laid aside. A lighter, less constrained style, which
may be called eclectic&mdash;which means selecting&mdash;because it
takes freely from any and all styles whatever suits its purpose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
is arising; and as this selecting is being every year
more and more intelligently done, and as original ideas are
constantly being incorporated with those chosen, the prospects
for architecture are more promising than ever before
in this country. The Casino, at Newport, is a fine example
of a modern building; and the still more recent Casino in
New York shows a fine example of the adapting of ideas
from Saracenic architecture to American uses. The Capitol
at Albany has many fine features, but it is the work of
several designers who did not harmonize. Memorial Hall,
at Cambridge, is one of the more striking of modern American
buildings, but its sky-line&mdash;that is, its outline as seen
against the sky&mdash;lacks simplicity and repose.</p>

<p>The churches in this country exhibit the widest variety
of style. Trinity Church in New York was the first Gothic
church erected in America, and Trinity Church in Boston, one
of the latest churches of importance, is also Gothic, though of
the variety called Norman Gothic, and considerably varied.
The Roman Catholic Cathedral of New York, and many
others of less magnitude, might be cited as a proof that
American architecture is advancing, and that we may speak
hopefully of its future.</p>

<p>Railroad depots and school-houses of certain types are
among the most distinctive and characteristic American
edifices. The first, especially, are being constructed more
nearly in accordance with the ancient principle of suiting
the structure to its uses than are any other buildings that
are worthy to be considered architecturally. Art museums
and public libraries, too, now form an important feature
in both town and country, and, in short, the beginning of
American architecture, for that is all that can be claimed
for what as yet exists, is such as would be the natural outcome
of a nation such as ours&mdash;varied, restless, bold, ugly,
original, and progressive. All these terms can be applied
to American art, but in and through it all there is a promise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
of something more. As greater age will bring repose
and dignity of bearing to our people, so our Fine Arts will
take on the best of our characteristics; as we outgrow our
national crudities the change will be shown in our architecture,
and we may well anticipate that in the future we shall
command the consideration and assume the same importance
in these regards that our excellence in the Useful Arts
has already won for us in all the world.</p>
